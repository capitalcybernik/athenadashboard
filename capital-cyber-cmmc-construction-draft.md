# CMMC Compliance for Construction Companies

You have 47 subcontractors on this job. Your project manager stores drawings on Dropbox. The prime just sent CMMC flow-down requirements. You have 90 days to comply or you're off the project.

We get you there.

## The Construction CMMC Problem

Construction firms win DoD contracts then discover the compliance iceberg:

**Subcontractor Whack-a-Mole** — You're the GC. Your concrete sub stores CUI on a personal laptop. Your electrical sub emails drawings to their Hotmail. Your HVAC vendor has never heard of NIST 800-171. Their non-compliance is your liability.

**Job Site Connectivity** — Project trailers with consumer-grade WiFi. Superintendents accessing CUI on personal phones. No network segmentation because the site won't exist in 18 months.

**Plan Room Pandemonium** — CUI lives in Blueprint, Procore, Aconex, and six email inboxes. Revision control doesn't exist. "Latest drawing" means whoever spoke to the architect last.

**Seasonal Workforce Churn** — 300% annual turnover in labor. New hires every Monday. No time for security training. Even less time for background checks.

**Multi-Project Sprawl** — Simultaneous jobs in three states. Different primes. Different CUI types. Different compliance deadlines. Your one-size-fits-all security program fits none of them.

**Paper Isn't Dead** — Assembly drawings in the trailer. Redlines on the shop floor. CUI on paper gets left in pickup trucks, copied at FedEx, and tossed in job site dumpsters.

## How We Approach Construction CMMC

### 1. Project-Based CUI Scoping

We map CUI by project, not by company:
- Which projects touch DoD?
- What CUI types? (drawings, specs, pricing, schedules)
- Where does it live? (plan rooms, email, mobile devices, paper)
- Who touches it? (employees, subs, vendors, inspectors)

Then we build project-specific security controls that don't slow down commercial work.

### 2. Subcontractor Compliance Program

Flow-down requirements that actually work:
- Pre-qualification security questionnaire
- Subcontractor CMMC attestation clauses
- Required controls checklist (minimum viable security)
- Quarterly compliance verification
- Incident reporting requirements

You can't control their networks. But you can control their access to your CUI.

### 3. Mobile-First Security

Superintendents live on tablets. We secure them:
- Mobile device management (MDM) with CUI containerization
- VPN-required access to plan rooms
- Remote wipe for lost/stolen devices
- Geofencing (CUI access only at job sites, not coffee shops)

### 4. Plan Room Control

One authoritative source of truth:
- Consolidated document management (Procore/Autodesk integration)
- Version control with check-in/check-out
- Access logs (who viewed what, when, from where)
- Automated CUI marking and handling warnings
- Secure destruction workflows for obsolete drawings

### 5. Rapid Workforce Training

Security awareness for construction timelines:
- 15-minute onboarding module (watch it in the truck)
- Annual refresher with construction-specific scenarios
- Job site signage (CUI handling, phishing awareness)
- Incident response cards (wallet-sized "what to do if...")

## What You Get

**Project Security Plans** — Per-project CUI maps, subcontractor requirements, and site-specific controls. One DoD job secured. Commercial jobs unaffected.

**Subcontractor Management** — Tracking system for sub compliance status. Red/yellow/green dashboard. Automatic alerts when a sub's attestation expires.

**Mobile Device Security** — MDM deployment across tablets and phones. CUI access secured without killing usability. Lost device? Wiped in 30 seconds.

**Plan Room Consolidation** — Single source for drawings and specs. CUI marked automatically. Access logged completely. Revisions tracked obsessively.

**C3PAO Readiness** — Documentation that holds up under assessment. Evidence collection that proves continuous compliance. Mock interviews that prepare your PMs for the real thing.

## Construction-Specific Controls We Implement

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Personal Dropbox for drawings | Procore/Autodesk integration with CUI marking |
| Sub unqualified for CMMC | Tiered flow-down with minimum security requirements |
| Lost tablets on job sites | MDM with geofencing + remote wipe |
| Plan revisions everywhere | Single plan room with check-in/check-out |
| CUI on paper in trailers | Secure printing + locked storage + shred bins |
| 90-day project compliance kick | Rapid deployment playbook for urgent compliance |

## The Construction CMMC Timeline

**Week 1: Emergency Scoping**
- Active project audit (which jobs have CUI?)
- CUI inventory (where does it live right now?)
- Subcontractor notification (compliance requirements flow-down)
- Critical gap identification (what will fail assessment?)

**Weeks 2-4: Quick Wins**
- Plan room consolidation
- Mobile device enrollment
- Subcontractor agreements updated
- CUI marking protocol deployed

**Months 2-4: Core Infrastructure**
- Network segmentation (project by project)
- MFA on all CUI access points
- Logging and monitoring active
- Training program launched

**Months 5-6: Documentation & Validation**
- System Security Plan (SSP) completed per project
- Evidence collection operational
- Subcontractor compliance verified
- Mock assessment conducted

**Month 7: Certification**
- C3PAO assessment
- POA&M closure (if needed)
- Certification achieved

**Ongoing: Continuous Compliance**
- New project onboarding (same playbook, faster)
- Subcontractor re-attestation (annual)
- Quarterly self-assessments
- Annual C3PAO renewal prep

## ROI: What CMMC Compliance Gets You

**Prime Contract Retention** — General Dynamics and Boeing won't keep you on without certification. One $5M project lost costs more than full compliance.

**Subcontractor Competitive Advantage** — Be the GC that helps subs get compliant. Attract better subcontractors. Win more bids.

**Insurance Premium Reduction** — Documented controls = lower premiums. Some carriers now require CMMC-aligned security for construction cyber policies.

**Ransomware Resilience** — The same segmentation that passes CMMC contains outbreaks. One prevented attack saves your project schedule and your reputation.

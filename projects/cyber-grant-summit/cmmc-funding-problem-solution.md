# CMMC Funding for Manufacturing Firms: Problem & Solution

---

## Executive Summary

Manufacturing firms across the United States face an unprecedented compliance challenge: achieving Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) to remain eligible for federal contracts. Yet most lack the financial resources, technical expertise, and time to implement the required controls. The Cyber Grants Alliance, in partnership with CMMC Ready Now, is solving this critical problem by providing grants and tools that make CMMC compliance financially accessible and operationally manageable for manufacturing firms of all sizes.

## The Problem: Why Manufacturing Firms Are Struggling with CMMC

### 1. The Federal Mandate Creates an Urgent Compliance Crisis

The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has mandated that all contractors and subcontractors in the defense industrial base must achieve CMMC certification to remain eligible for federal contracts. For manufacturing firms that depend on government contracts for revenue—often 20-40% of their business—this is not optional. It is a survival requirement.

**The Challenge:** CMMC requires organizations to implement and maintain a comprehensive set of cybersecurity controls across five maturity levels. For manufacturing firms, this means:

- Implementing new security technologies and infrastructure
- Training employees on cybersecurity best practices
- Establishing new processes and documentation
- Conducting regular assessments and audits
- Maintaining continuous compliance over time

### 2. The Cost Barrier Is Prohibitive for Most Manufacturing Firms

Implementing CMMC compliance is expensive. The total cost varies based on current security posture and target maturity level, but typical expenses include:

| Cost Category | Estimated Range |
|:---|:---|
| Security Assessment & Audit | $5,000 - $15,000 |
| Control Implementation | $25,000 - $100,000+ |
| Training & Awareness Programs | $3,000 - $10,000 |
| Compliance Tracking Tools | $2,400 - $5,000+ annually |
| Certification & Recertification | $5,000 - $20,000 |
| **Total First-Year Cost** | **$40,000 - $150,000+** |

For small and mid-sized manufacturing firms operating on tight margins, this investment represents a significant financial burden. Many firms delay compliance efforts, hoping for extensions or relief—a strategy that puts their federal contract eligibility at risk.

### 3. Manufacturing Firms Lack In-House Cybersecurity Expertise

Most manufacturing firms are not technology companies. Their core competency is manufacturing—producing quality products efficiently. Cybersecurity is often an afterthought, managed by IT staff who are already stretched thin managing day-to-day operations.

**The Reality:**
- Manufacturing firms typically have small IT teams (often 1-3 people)
- These teams lack specialized cybersecurity expertise
- Hiring external consultants is expensive and ongoing
- There is no clear roadmap for achieving and maintaining compliance
- Firms struggle to understand what controls they need and how to implement them

### 4. Time and Resource Constraints Make Compliance Difficult

Manufacturing operations run 24/7. Implementing security controls, training employees, and managing compliance processes requires time and attention that manufacturing firms can ill afford to spare.

**The Operational Challenge:**
- Production cannot stop for security implementations
- Employees are focused on manufacturing, not cybersecurity
- Management lacks bandwidth to oversee compliance projects
- There is no dedicated compliance officer or team
- Compliance becomes another task added to already-full plates

### 5. Uncertainty About Grant Availability and Application Process

While federal grants for CMMC compliance exist, many manufacturing firms are unaware of them. Even those who know about grants often struggle with:

- Understanding eligibility requirements
- Navigating complex application processes
- Finding grants that match their specific needs
- Accessing expert guidance on grant applications
- Coordinating multiple grants for different compliance needs

### 6. The Risk of Non-Compliance Is Severe

Manufacturing firms that fail to achieve CMMC certification face serious consequences:

- **Loss of Federal Contracts:** Ineligibility to bid on or renew DoD contracts
- **Revenue Impact:** Potential loss of 20-40% of annual revenue
- **Competitive Disadvantage:** Competitors who achieve compliance gain market advantage
- **Reputational Damage:** Loss of customer trust and business relationships
- **Operational Disruption:** Sudden loss of major revenue streams forces layoffs and restructuring

# Capital Cyber Website Analysis & CMMC Manufacturing/Construction Strategy
## Prepared by Ares | February 17, 2026

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Capital Cyber's website is well built for dental and CPA verticals but **invisible to manufacturing and construction contractors seeking CMMC compliance**. The site mentions "government contractors" as an afterthought rather than a primary audience. Meanwhile, competitors like Summit7, E-N Computers, Stratify IT, and KAMIND all have dedicated industry pages, manufacturing-specific FAQ content, and case studies that directly address the concerns of shop floor operators, fabricators, and construction firms handling CUI.

**The opportunity is massive and time-sensitive.** CMMC Phase 1 enforcement began November 2025. Most small manufacturers and construction subs still aren't compliant. None of the respondents in a recent Cybersecurity Dive survey reported full SPRS scores of 110. There are fewer than 60 C3PAOs for 30,000+ companies. The demand far exceeds supply. Capital Cyber is positioned in Northern Virginia (the densest defense corridor in the country) but the website doesn't capitalize on that geography or the manufacturing/construction audience.

**Bottom line:** With targeted content, two new landing pages, and a messaging pivot, Capital Cyber can capture manufacturing/construction CMMC leads within 30 days.

## PART 1: WEBSITE AUDIT

### 1.1 Homepage Issues

**What's there:**
- Hero: "Your Ultimate Shield Against Ransomware: Securing Dentists, DSOs, CPAs, and Government Contractors"
- "We Can Help" section: Solo Practitioner, Multi Location Dental, DSOs, Accountants, Government Contractors, Private Schools
- Case studies: Iron Lift (?), Limberakis Dental, John Geantasio CPA, Radiant Dental
- Testimonials: CPA, dental practice, consulting firm

**Problems:**

| # | Issue | Severity | Detail |
|---|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | **Dental-first positioning alienates manufacturing prospects** | CRITICAL | The word "dentist" or "dental" appears 8+ times on the homepage. "Manufacturing" appears 0 times. "Construction" appears 0 times. A manufacturing VP lands on this page and immediately thinks "this isn't for me." |
| 2 | **"Government Contractors" is too vague** | HIGH | Every CMMC firm says "government contractors." You need to say "defense manufacturers," "DoD construction subs," "machine shops handling CUI." Specificity builds trust. |
| 3 | **No urgency around CMMC deadlines** | HIGH | CMMC Phase 1 is already in effect. Phase 2 is coming. There's no mention of deadlines, phased rollout, or the consequences of non-compliance (losing contracts). |
| 4 | **Case studies don't include manufacturing or construction** | HIGH | Iron Lift case study URL actually loads Limberakis Dental content (possible broken link or misrouted page). Zero manufacturing/construction social proof. |
| 5 | **"20,000 passwords cracked" stat is misplaced** | MEDIUM | This is a pen-testing credential that appeals to security nerds, not to a manufacturing CEO wondering if they'll lose their DoD contract. Reframe it as an outcome: "We found vulnerabilities in X% of the companies we tested." |
| 6 | **No industry-specific entry points** | MEDIUM | The "We Can Help" section lists practice types but all are dental/CPA focused. No card for "Manufacturers" or "Construction Contractors." |

### 1.2 CMMC Page Issues

**Current state:** ~767 characters of actual content (excluding HTML). This is **critically thin**. Competitors have 3,000 to 8,000+ words on their CMMC pages.

| # | Issue | Severity | Detail |
|---|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | **Almost no content** | CRITICAL | The page is essentially a pricing table and two sentences. No explanation of what CMMC is, why it matters, the certification process, timelines, or what CUI means. |
| 2 | **Pricing table lacks context** | HIGH | "Bid Ready / Audit Ready / CISO in a Box" tiers are unclear without explanation. What does "Bid Ready" actually include? How long does it take? |
| 3 | **No mention of DFARS 7012/7019/7020** | HIGH | These are the contract clauses that make CMMC mandatory. Manufacturing prospects searching for DFARS compliance won't find you. |
| 4 | **No SPRS scoring explanation** | HIGH | Manufacturers are panicking about their SPRS scores. None surveyed had a score of 110. This is a huge pain point you don't address. |
| 5 | **No manufacturing or construction specific language** | CRITICAL | No mention of shop floor security, legacy CNC machines, ERP scoping, CAD/CAM in secure enclaves, ITAR overlap, or subcontractor flow-down requirements. |
| 6 | **Missing SEO keywords** | HIGH | Not ranking for: "CMMC manufacturing," "CMMC construction," "CMMC Virginia," "NIST 800-171 manufacturer," "defense contractor compliance Virginia" |

### 1.3 Other Service Pages

**NIST Gap Assessment page:** ~1,354 characters. Generic description, no specifics about what the assessment covers, how long it takes, what deliverables the client gets, or pricing.

**vCSO Services page:** ~817 characters. Even thinner. No explanation of what a vCSO does day-to-day, no comparison to hiring a full-time CISO, no pricing range.

**Managed IT page:** ~7,949 characters. This is the best page on the site. Detailed, organized, covers services comprehensively. But it's entirely focused on dental/CPA/healthcare. The statistics cited are all healthcare-specific. No manufacturing or construction IT management content.

### 1.4 Technical/SEO Issues

| Issue | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| No `/manufacturing` or `/construction` landing pages | Missing entirely |
| No blog/content marketing | No educational CMMC articles, guides, or checklists |
| No lead magnets | No downloadable CUI identification guides, self-assessment tools, or SPRS calculators |
| No schema markup visible | Missing LocalBusiness, Service, FAQ schema |
| Broken/misrouted case study | Iron Lift URL loads Limberakis Dental content |
| No geographic SEO | Not targeting "CMMC Virginia," "cybersecurity Leesburg VA," "defense contractor IT Northern Virginia" |
| CTA is generic | "Schedule a Call" doesn't communicate value. Better: "Get Your Free CMMC Readiness Score" |
| Facebook link instead of LinkedIn | Managed IT page links to Facebook for "Contact Capital Cyber" when manufacturing/construction decision makers live on LinkedIn |

---

## PART 2: COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

### 2.1 Direct Competitors (Virginia/DC Area)

| Company | Location | Strengths | Weakness |
|---------|----------|-----------|----------|
| **E-N Computers** | Virginia/DC | RPO certified, 30 years experience, focuses on manufacturers and design firms, MSP + CMMC consultant in one | Regional focus only |
| **Stratify IT** | Virginia | Specializes in Virginia's "defense corridor," Norfolk to Pentagon, accelerated compliance programs | Newer firm |
| **KAMIND** | Virginia (national) | Dedicated Virginia landing page, GCC High migration specialist | Less MSP integration |
| **IBSS Corp** | Virginia | C3PAO certified, deep DoD relationships | Enterprise focused |
| **PlatformOne (cmmcitar.com)** | Virginia | MSP + MSSP, SMB focus, ITAR specialist | Smaller brand |

**Key Insight:** E-N Computers is your closest competitor. They're in Virginia, they do MSP + CMMC consulting (same as you), and they specifically call out manufacturers and design firms. Their "Best CMMC Consultants" article ranks highly and drives organic traffic. You should be doing the same.

### 2.2 National Competitors (Manufacturing Focused)

| Company | Approach | What They Do Right |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| **Summit7** | Enterprise CMMC for manufacturers | Dedicated `/solutions/manufacturing` page with FAQ content about CNC machines, ERP scoping, ITAR overlap, CAD/CAM in enclaves, subcontractor flow-down. Case study with Clinkenbeard (contract manufacturer). This is the gold standard. |
| **VC3** | Mid-market CMMC | Separate "Manufacturing" and "Aerospace and Defense" verticals. Clean navigation. |
| **CyberSheath** | CMMC roadmap planning | Strong content marketing: "Planning Your 2026 CMMC Compliance Roadmap" article. Educates before selling. |
| **EisnerAmper** | CPA firm + advisory | Published dedicated articles for both manufacturing CMMC AND construction CMMC. Cross-selling from audit/advisory into cyber. |

**What competitors do that Capital Cyber doesn't:**
1. Industry-specific landing pages (manufacturing, construction, aerospace)
2. FAQ sections addressing real manufacturing concerns (legacy systems, ERP, ITAR)
3. Manufacturing case studies with named companies
4. Geographic landing pages (Virginia, DC, etc.)
5. Educational blog content that ranks for informational keywords
6. Lead magnets (assessments, checklists, calculators)

## PART 3: MANUFACTURING & CONSTRUCTION PAIN POINTS

### 3.1 Manufacturing CMMC Challenges (From Research)

These are the specific problems manufacturers face that Capital Cyber must address on its website:

1. **Legacy Systems & Industrial Control Systems (ICS):** Most manufacturing floors run CNC machines, PLCs, and SCADA systems that weren't built with cybersecurity in mind. These can't be easily patched or updated. Compensating controls are required.

2. **CUI on the Shop Floor:** Engineering drawings, specifications, part numbers, and technical data packages (TDP) are CUI. They flow through CAD stations, ERP systems, email, and sometimes paper printouts on the shop floor. Scoping where CUI lives is hard.

3. **ERP System Scoping:** If an ERP system (SAP, Epicor, JobBOSS) touches CUI (even indirectly through linked documents), it's in scope for CMMC. Misclassifying ERP is a common audit failure.

4. **CAD/CAM Software in Secure Enclaves:** AutoCAD, SolidWorks, Mastercam, and similar tools need to run inside CMMC-compliant environments. This often means Azure Virtual Desktop with GPU acceleration in GCC High. It's complex and expensive.

5. **ITAR Overlap:** Many defense manufacturers handle ITAR-controlled data. ITAR requires U.S. persons only access. CMMC + ITAR together create compounding compliance requirements. Violations carry criminal penalties.

6. **Subcontractor Flow-Down:** If a manufacturer shares CUI with a heat treater, plating shop, or any sub, that sub must also be CMMC certified at the same level. Most small subs don't know this.

7. **Multi-Entity Compliance:** Acquisitions and mergers create multi-entity structures where both companies need separate CMMC certification. This is extremely common in manufacturing.

8. **Resource Constraints:** Small manufacturers (20 to 100 employees) don't have IT departments. They can't afford full-time cybersecurity staff. They need an MSP/MSSP that understands manufacturing.

9. **SPRS Scores:** No surveyed manufacturers reported a score of 110 (required for full compliance). 17% still had negative scores. This is a crisis.

10. **Cost:** CMMC Level 2 compliance costs $75,000 to $200,000 for a small business. Assessment fees alone run $30,000 to $70,000. Manufacturers need to budget this into overhead.

### 3.2 Construction CMMC Challenges (From Research)

1. **Project-Based IT:** Construction companies set up temporary offices at job sites with varying levels of IT infrastructure. Securing CUI across multiple, temporary locations is fundamentally different from securing a fixed office.

2. **Subcontractor Sprawl:** A typical DoD construction project involves dozens of subcontractors. CUI flow-down requirements apply to every sub that touches sensitive data. Managing compliance across a fragmented supply chain is the #1 construction-specific challenge.

3. **Legacy Systems and Paper Processes:** Construction lags behind other sectors in cybersecurity adoption (per the American Bar Association). Many firms still rely on paper plans, USB drives, and unsecured file sharing.

4. **Public Works Exposure:** Roads, bridges, military bases, and public buildings funded by federal/local programs all fall under DoD contracting requirements. Construction companies that never thought of themselves as "defense contractors" are suddenly in scope.

5. **Documentation Culture Gap:** Construction firms aren't used to creating and maintaining cybersecurity policies, procedures, and evidence of implementation. This organizational maturity gap is even wider than in manufacturing.

6. **Ongoing Compliance:** CMMC isn't a one-time certification. Construction companies must continuously monitor systems, update practices, and maintain audit readiness through their 3-year certification cycle.

7. **Surety/Bonding Implications:** Construction companies that lose DoD eligibility due to CMMC non-compliance may also face bonding issues, since bonding companies evaluate financial stability and contract pipeline.

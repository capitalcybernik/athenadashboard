# CMMC 2.0 Skill

Authoritative reference for advising on CMMC 2.0 compliance. Capital Cyber provides CMMC compliance services as a core offering.

## Quick Reference

| Level | Data Type | Controls | Assessment | Reassessment |
|-------|-----------|----------|------------|--------------|
| 1 Foundational | FCI | 17 (from FAR 52.204-21) | Annual self-assessment + senior official affirmation | Annual |
| 2 Advanced | CUI | 110 (NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2) | Self-assessment (Phase 1) → C3PAO (Phase 2+) | Triennial |
| 3 Expert | Critical CUI | 110 + 24 from NIST SP 800-172 | Government-led (DIBCAC) | Triennial |

## Level Details

See `references/levels.md` for complete breakdown of all three levels including:
- Level 1: All 15 FAR 52.204-21 practices (mapping to 17 NIST 800-171 requirements)
- Level 2: 110 NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2 controls across 14 families
- Level 3: 24 enhanced controls from NIST SP 800-172 + protection strategies

## Implementation Timeline

See `references/timeline.md` for the four-phase rollout schedule (Nov 2025 through Nov 2028+).

## Key Concepts

See `references/concepts.md` for definitions and explanations of:
- FCI vs CUI
- SPRS (Supplier Performance Risk System)
- C3PAO (Certified Third-Party Assessment Organization)
- DIBCAC (Defense Industrial Base Cybersecurity Assessment Center)
- POA&M (Plan of Action & Milestones)
- SSP (System Security Plan)
- Scoping (enterprise vs enclave)
- Flowdown requirements for subcontractors
- GCC High / cloud considerations

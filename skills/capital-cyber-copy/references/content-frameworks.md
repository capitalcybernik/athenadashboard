## Website Copy

### Page Structure
Every service/location page follows:
1. H1 with primary keyword
2. Problem statement (who needs this and why)
3. Service description (what we do, how it works)
4. Differentiators (why Capital Cyber)
5. Social proof (stats, retention rate, experience)
6. CTA: Book a Call + Contact Form

### Writing Rules for Web
- Sentences under 20 words when possible
- Paragraphs under 4 lines
- Use bullet points for lists of 3+
- Bold key phrases for scanners
- No jargon without explanation
- Every page answers: "What's in it for me?"

# Email Frameworks — Capital Cyber & CGA

## CGA Grant Outreach (Cold, 3-Email Sequence)

### Pattern: Volunteer Voice + Regulatory Urgency + Case Study

**Sender persona:** CGA Volunteer (not salesperson)
**Spacing:** 5-7 days between emails
**Technical:** 90-second delay between sends, rotate 5 sender accounts

---

### Email 1: Introduction + Grant Offer

**Subject line formula:** `Cybersecurity grant for {company_name}`

**Structure:**
1. Personal intro as CGA volunteer
2. Reference specific regulation affecting their industry
3. Quantify penalty/risk with specific dollar amounts
4. Introduce grant as solution
5. Simple CTA: "2 minutes to apply" + link
6. Sign off with name, title, phone, website

**Example opening (CPA vertical):**
> Hi {first_name},
>
> I'm reaching out as a volunteer with the Cyber Grants Alliance, a nonprofit on a mission to help accounting firms strengthen their cybersecurity posture without the heavy price tag.
>
> As you may know, the FTC Safeguards Rule now classifies all CPA firms and tax preparers as "financial institutions," which means your firm is legally required to implement specific security controls and maintain a Written Information Security Program (WISP). Penalties for failing to comply can reach up to $100,000 per violation.

**Example opening (Gov Contractor vertical):**
> Hi {first_name},
>
> I'm reaching out as a volunteer with the Cyber Grants Alliance. We help defense contractors and manufacturers achieve CMMC compliance through cybersecurity grants that cover the cost of assessments, compliance tracking tools, and training.
>
> With CMMC Phase 1 enforcement underway, firms in the defense supply chain that can't demonstrate compliance risk losing their contract eligibility.

### Email 2: Urgency + FBI/Regulatory Hook

**Subject line formula:** `FBI warning relevant to {company_name}`

**Structure:**
1. Reference Email 1 briefly
2. Lead with timely news (FBI Operation Winter SHIELD, new regulation, breach)
3. Industry-specific risk statistics
4. Restate grant offer
5. Slightly stronger CTA

**Key stat block to include:**
> On January 28, 2026, the FBI launched Operation Winter SHIELD, a 10-week national campaign identifying the most critical cybersecurity actions organizations need to take right now. 43% of all cyberattacks target small and medium businesses, and Q1 2025 set the record for the highest number of ransomware victims ever reported.

### Email 3: Case Study + Final Push

**Subject line formula:** `{Industry} firm fined ${amount} after {incident}`

**Structure:**
1. Acknowledge their busy schedule ("I'll keep this brief")
2. Real case study with company name, dollar amounts, consequences
3. Quote from regulatory authority
4. Penalty escalation data
5. Personal liability angle for decision-makers
6. Final CTA: "Don't wait until it's your firm in the headline."

**Example case (CPA):**
> Wojeski & Company, a CPA firm, was hit with a $60,000 penalty by the New York Attorney General after a ransomware attack exposed over 4,700 clients' Social Security numbers, financial records, and medical information. The firm took a year and a half to notify affected clients.

## Subject Line Principles

- **Personalize:** Include company name or industry
- **Specific > clever:** "Cybersecurity grant for {company}" beats "Your security matters"
- **Create curiosity:** "FBI warning relevant to {company}" (only if content backs it up)
- **Avoid spam triggers:** No ALL CAPS, no !!!, no "FREE" in subject
- **Short:** Under 50 characters when possible

## Footer Requirements (CAN-SPAM)

Every email must include:
- Sender name, title, phone
- Organization name and website
- Physical mailing address
- Unsubscribe link
- No misleading "From" or "Subject" lines

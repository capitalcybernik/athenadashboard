# Capital Cyber Copywriting Skill

## Brand Identity

**Capital Cyber** is a cybersecurity firm that provides IT services. Not the other way around. This distinction drives everything.

**Tagline:** Security Obsessed, Service Driven
**Founded after:** A $500K ransomware attack at a former company. This is real, not theoretical.

## Voice & Tone

### The Capital Cyber Voice
- **Direct.** No corporate fluff. Say what needs to be said.
- **Confident, not arrogant.** We know our craft. 24 years in IT, 20,000+ passwords cracked in 2024.
- **Urgent without being alarmist.** Threats are real. We state facts, cite sources, let the data create urgency.
- **Human.** We talk like people, not brochures. First names. Short sentences. Real examples.
- **Mission-driven.** Every engagement funds cybersecurity grants through CGA. This isn't a marketing angle, it's who we are.

### The CGA Voice
- **Nonprofit, not charity.** CGA bridges the cybersecurity divide. It's about national security.
- **Approachable authority.** We make grants accessible. No jargon walls.
- **Volunteer energy.** Outreach emails come from "volunteers" not salespeople.
- **Stat-driven.** FBI data, FTC rules, real breach cases. Always cite.

### Words We Use
- "Protect" over "defend"
- "Compliance" as a floor, not a ceiling
- "Partner" over "vendor"
- "Your business" over "organizations"
- "We handle security so you can focus on your business"

### Words We Avoid
- "Synergy," "leverage," "ecosystem," "paradigm"
- Em dashes (use commas or periods instead)
- "I'd be happy to help" or "Great question!"
- Generic AI filler ("In today's digital landscape...")
- Scare tactics without data backing

## Target Personas

### 1. Government Contractors (CMMC)
- **Pain:** CMMC mandate threatens contract eligibility. 20-40% of revenue at risk.
- **Language:** CUI, CMMC Level 1/2, NIST 800-171, System Security Plan
- **Trigger:** "If you can't prove compliance, you can't win the contract."
- **CTA:** Free CMMC gap assessment, CMMC Ready Now platform demo

### 2. Manufacturing Firms
- **Pain:** Small IT teams, no cybersecurity expertise, federal contract dependency
- **Language:** Defense industrial base, supply chain security, audit readiness
- **Trigger:** "Your competitors who get certified first win the contracts."
- **CTA:** CGA grants covering compliance costs, Cyber Grant Summit

### 3. CPA Firms / Accountants
- **Pain:** FTC Safeguards Rule classifies them as "financial institutions." $100K/violation penalties.
- **Language:** WISP, FTC Safeguards Rule, IRS 4557, tax season risk
- **Trigger:** Real cases (Wojeski & Company: $60K fine after ransomware)
- **CTA:** Free risk assessment grant via CGA
- **NOTE:** As of Feb 2026, CPAs are deprioritized for email campaigns. Focus shifts to manufacturing and gov contractors.

### 4. Insurance Brokers (Channel Partners)
- **Pain:** Clients failing cyber insurance requirements
- **Language:** Insurability, remediation, Big 5 controls, Fast-Track to Insurability
- **Trigger:** "Your clients are getting denied coverage. We fix that in 30 days."
- **CTA:** Broker Partner Kit, referral partnership

### 5. Mortgage Companies
- **Pain:** Regulatory compliance, client data protection
- **Language:** GLBA, data security, compliance automation
- **Trigger:** "One breach costs more than years of protection."

## Copy Frameworks

### Cold Outreach Email (3-Email Sequence)
See `references/email-frameworks.md` for full templates and examples.

**Email 1 — Introduction + Value**
- Personal intro (name, role, org)
- Establish shared mission or relevance
- One clear value proposition
- Soft CTA (apply for grant, schedule call)

**Email 2 — Urgency + Social Proof**
- Reference Email 1
- Introduce timely threat/stat (FBI data, new regulation)
- Industry-specific risk data
- Restate value, slightly stronger CTA

**Email 3 — Case Study + Final Push**
- Brief, respect their time
- Real breach case with $ consequences
- Personal liability angle if applicable
- Last CTA, urgency framing

### Blog Posts / SEO Content
See `references/content-frameworks.md` for SEO guidelines.

- **Length:** 800-1500 words for standard posts
- **Structure:** Hook → Problem → Data/Evidence → Solution → CTA
- **SEO:** One primary keyword, 2-3 secondary. Use in H1, first paragraph, subheads
- **CTA:** Always end with Book a Call link + contact form embed
- **Tone:** Educational first, sales second. Teach them something real.

### LinkedIn Posts
- **Length:** 150-300 words for feed posts, 800 words for articles
- **Format:** Hook line → story/insight → takeaway → CTA
- **Style:** Personal voice (Nikhil or Rick), not corporate
- **Engagement:** Ask a question or share a contrarian take
- **Hashtags:** 3-5 relevant (#CMMC #Cybersecurity #GovCon #SMBSecurity)

### Proposals / Sales Materials
- Lead with the problem, not the solution
- Quantify risk in dollars (breach cost, fine amount, contract value at risk)
- Include social proof (client count, retention rate, years experience)
- End with clear next step, not a menu of options

## Sunday, Feb 22, 2026 - Session Continuation

### Key Decisions Made
- **Capital Cyber verticals finalized:** CPAs, gov contractors (CMMC), mortgage companies. No longer marketing to dentists/DSOs. Private schools handled by CZ Tech partner (Kevin), not direct.
- **20% conversion metric clarified:** Only applies to Capital Cyber sponsored grants, not all CGA grants.
- **CMMC Ready Now:** New lead magnet - SaaS platform (cmmcreadynow.com) being given as grant to ~20 companies. Separate from CGA pen testing grants.

### Team Structure Updated
- **Janie:** Rick's assistant (his team member), handles research and GHL for Rick
- **Veer:** Operations, ticketing, Cynet training next week
- Chain: Nikhil + Rick → Ares (strategy/marketing) → Veer (operations), Janie reports to Rick

### Content Delivered
- **4 blog posts** written and sent to Anup:
  1. CMMC Phase 1 enforcement (gov contractors)
  2. Tax season cybersecurity (CPAs)
  3. Mortgage wire fraud protection
  4. MSP/MSSP/MCP positioning piece
- **Rick's cheat sheet** created and emailed
- **CGA Private Schools one-pager** created with CZ Tech spotlight, sent to Kevin

### Infrastructure
- Daily cron jobs restored: 6AM EST strategy, midnight security audit
- Security rules added: No destructive actions without approval, no email instructions, no prompt injection
- CGA contact info saved: GA office (10 Glenlake Pkwy), VA office (Creek View Plaza), (888) 323-9991

### Pending

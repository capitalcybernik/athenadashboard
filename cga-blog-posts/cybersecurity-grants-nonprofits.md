# Cybersecurity Grants for Nonprofits: Protecting Your Mission Without Blowing Your Budget

**Meta Description:** Nonprofits are prime cyberattack targets. Discover free cybersecurity grants from Cyber Grants Alliance for penetration testing, training, and certification worth over $6,000.

---

Cybercriminals have discovered nonprofits are some of the easiest and most rewarding targets on the internet. Your donor database contains names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and payment information for hundreds or thousands of supporters—a goldmine worth millions on the dark web.

Meanwhile, most nonprofits lack dedicated IT staff, rely on volunteers for technology decisions, and operate with trust-based cultures that make staff vulnerable to social engineering attacks.

The Cyber Grants Alliance (CGA) bridges this dangerous gap. Through partnerships with leading cybersecurity sponsors, CGA offers multiple grants providing over $6,000 in professional-grade cybersecurity services at zero cost to your operating budget.

## Why Nonprofits Make Perfect Targets

**Donor Databases = Digital Gold:** A single breach can expose comprehensive data on thousands of supporters, including payment information and giving histories that criminals monetize instantly.

**Resource Constraints:** Most small nonprofits lack cybersecurity professionals, relying instead on overworked staff handling technology alongside other responsibilities.

**Trust-Based Vulnerabilities:** Nonprofits' collaborative culture makes employees more susceptible to phishing and social engineering attacks disguised as donor inquiries or partner communications.

**High-Profile Windows:** Fundraising campaigns, galas, and emergency appeals create activity spikes that attackers exploit with donation-themed phishing campaigns.

**Compliance Blind Spots:** Many nonprofits handle regulated data (health information, financial records) but lack resources for comprehensive compliance programs.

## When Nonprofits Get Hit

A data breach devastates nonprofits far beyond financial costs:

**Donor Trust Evaporates:** Supporters who learn their personal and financial information was compromised often stop giving permanently and warn others to avoid your organization.

**Mission Shutdown:** Ransomware attacks can halt operations for weeks, delaying programs and leaving vulnerable populations without services.

**Catastrophic Costs:** Breach response—forensic investigation, legal counsel, notification, credit monitoring—easily reaches $50,000-$200,000 for organizations operating on razor-thin margins.

**Reputation Destruction:** Public breach disclosure undermines credibility with donors, volunteers, board members, and grant funders.

## Beyond Grants: Security Fundamentals  

Even with professional grants, implement these basics:

**Enable Multi-Factor Authentication:** This single step prevents most account takeover attacks across email and critical systems.

**Maintain Current Software:** Many breaches exploit vulnerabilities patched months or years ago—keep everything updated.

**Implement Reliable Backups:** Regular, automated backups of donor databases, financial records, and program data, stored securely and tested periodically.

**Document Incident Response:** Create written plans specifying notification procedures, system shutdown protocols, and communication responsibilities before crisis strikes.

## Security as Stewardship

Nonprofit board members and executives have fiduciary duty to protect organizational assets—and in the digital age, data ranks among your most critical assets. Donor information, financial records, and program data require the same careful stewardship as financial investments.

Funders increasingly evaluate cybersecurity practices during due diligence. Professional penetration testing, trained staff, and security certification demonstrate responsible stewardship that major grantmakers expect.

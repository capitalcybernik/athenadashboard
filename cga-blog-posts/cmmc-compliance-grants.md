# CMMC Compliance Doesn't Have to Break the Bank: Grant Programs for Defense Contractors

**Meta Description:** CMMC compliance can cost $75K to $200K. Learn how defense contractors can access a free $2,400/year compliance tracking tool grant from Cyber Grants Alliance to simplify the journey.

---

Your DoD contract just arrived with CMMC requirements. The Department of Defense isn't playing games anymore—Phase 1 enforcement is live, and contractors who can't demonstrate compliance are losing contracts to competitors who can.

The brutal reality? CMMC compliance costs between $75,000 and $200,000 for most small defense contractors. For a manufacturer with a handful of DoD contracts, that price tag can be business-ending.

The Cyber Grants Alliance (CGA) offers a solution: a CMMC Tracking Tool Grant worth $2,400 per year that provides qualifying defense contractors with comprehensive compliance management at zero cost.

## CMMC: Three Levels, One Goal

The Department of Defense created CMMC to replace the honor system with verified cybersecurity standards:

**Level 1:** Basic security hygiene (17 controls, self-assessment allowed)
**Level 2:** Advanced practices aligned with NIST SP 800-171 (110 controls, third-party assessment required for most)  
**Level 3:** Expert-level security for the most sensitive programs (additional NIST SP 800-172 controls)

Most small contractors need Level 2—and that's where costs explode.

## The Real Damage: What CMMC Actually Costs

**Gap Assessment:** $15,000-$30,000
**Remediation:** $30,000-$100,000+ (new tools, infrastructure upgrades, policies)
**Documentation:** $10,000-$25,000 (System Security Plans, POA&Ms, procedures)
**Assessment & Certification:** $20,000-$50,000
**Ongoing Compliance:** $10,000-$30,000 annually

Total: $75,000-$200,000+ upfront, plus ongoing costs that never end.

## The Hidden Killer: Compliance Tracking Chaos

Here's what nobody tells you about CMMC: managing 110 controls with spreadsheets and email chains is a nightmare waiting to happen.

When your C3PAO assessor arrives, you need organized evidence for every control, continuous monitoring documentation, and a clear audit trail. Spreadsheets break. Files get lost. Evidence disappears.

Professional compliance platforms solve this problem but add $2,000-$5,000 annually to your already crushing costs.

## The CGA Solution: Free Compliance Management

The CMMC Tracking Tool Grant, sponsored by [CMMC Ready Now](https://cmmcreadynow.com), eliminates this cost entirely with a $2,400 annual platform subscription that includes:

**Complete Control Mapping:** Every NIST 800-171 control mapped to your environment with real-time status tracking
**Evidence Automation:** Automatic collection and timestamping of compliance evidence
**Assessment Readiness:** Clean, organized documentation packages ready for C3PAO review
**Dashboard Reporting:** Real-time compliance status visible to your entire leadership team
**Expert Support:** Direct access to compliance professionals who understand defense contractor challenges

## Who Gets This Grant?

Any organization in the defense supply chain handling Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI):

- Prime defense contractors
- Defense subcontractors and suppliers  
- Aerospace manufacturers
- Defense IT service providers
- Engineering firms on DoD projects
- Government contractors subject to DFARS requirements

Whether you're starting your CMMC journey or actively pursuing certification, this grant saves thousands annually.

## DFARS, SPRS, and the Compliance Web

If you're already wrestling with DFARS clause 252.204-7012 and submitting SPRS scores, CMMC adds another layer of complexity. The tracking platform manages all these interconnected requirements in one place—your SPRS scores, NIST 800-171 implementation status, and CMMC readiness unified under a single dashboard.

## The Enforcement Reality

Phase 1 isn't a warning—it's happening now. CMMC requirements are appearing in DoD contracts, and contractors without proper compliance are losing opportunities to competitors who invested early.

Phase 2 will expand requirements across the entire defense industrial base. The window for preparation is closing fast.

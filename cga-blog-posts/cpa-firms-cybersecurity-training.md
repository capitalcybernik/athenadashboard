# Why Every CPA Firm Needs Cybersecurity Training (and How to Get It Free)

**Meta Description:** CPA firms face increasing cyber threats and regulatory pressure. Learn why cybersecurity training is now mandatory and how to get a free $1,000 training grant from Cyber Grants Alliance.

Wojeski and Company thought they were safe. This small CPA firm followed basic security practices, kept their software updated, and never experienced a major breach. Then regulators knocked on their door and slapped them with a $60,000 fine for inadequate cybersecurity—specifically, insufficient employee training.

Your CPA firm sits on a goldmine of sensitive data: Social Security numbers, bank details, tax returns, financial statements, payroll records. That data makes you an incredibly attractive target, and cybercriminals know most accounting firms lack the resources to defend it properly.

The federal government knows it too. The FTC Safeguards Rule now requires CPA firms to implement comprehensive cybersecurity training. It's not optional—it's law.

The Cyber Grants Alliance offers a cybersecurity training grant worth $1,000 annually, sponsored by [Telco United](https://telcounited.com), covering a complete training platform for your entire firm at zero cost.

## The Legal Reality: FTC Safeguards Rule Hits CPA Firms

The FTC's updated Safeguards Rule (effective June 2023) applies to tax preparers, accountants, and CPA firms under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act definition of "financial institutions."

Key requirements include:
- Designated security program oversight
- Regular risk assessments  
- **Mandatory employee security awareness training**
- Continuous monitoring and testing
- Written incident response plans

The Wojeski case proves regulators aren't bluffing. A $60,000 fine can destroy a small practice—and that was for compliance failures, not even an actual breach.

## Attack Season: Why Tax Time is Hunter Season

FBI Operation Winter Shield revealed that cybercriminals specifically target tax season when CPA firms are busiest and most vulnerable:

**Phishing Dominates:** Over 90% of successful attacks start with phishing emails disguised as IRS notices, client communications, or software vendor updates.

**Business Email Compromise Surges:** Attackers impersonate firm partners or clients to redirect wire transfers and steal sensitive documents.

**Distraction Factor:** Overwhelmed staff during busy season are more likely to click malicious links without proper verification.

A single successful attack can cost your firm hundreds of thousands in damages and client losses.

## What Real Training Actually Covers

The CGA training grant, sponsored by [Telco United](https://telcounited.com), covers a $1,000 annual platform license including:

**Targeted Phishing Simulations:** Your team receives realistic phishing tests throughout the year using scenarios specifically designed for accounting firms—fake IRS notices, client impersonation attempts, and software vendor scams.

**Interactive Security Modules:** Bite-sized training on password security, data handling, social engineering recognition, and safe browsing practices that fit into busy schedules.

**Incident Response Training:** Clear protocols for identifying, reporting, and containing security incidents—essential for regulatory compliance.

**Compliance Documentation:** Detailed tracking and reporting that provides documented evidence of your training program for regulatory audits.

## The True Cost of Skipping Training

Consider the financial reality for a typical CPA firm:

**Regulatory Penalties:** $60,000+ (proven by the Wojeski case)
**Data Breach Response:** $120,000+ average for small professional firms
**Client Losses:** Immeasurable—trust takes years to rebuild
**Insurance Issues:** Many policies require training documentation for coverage

Professional training platforms typically cost $800-$2,500 annually. The CGA grant covers this entirely.

The training grant is available to:
- CPA firms and accounting practices (solo to mid-size)
- Tax preparation services
- Bookkeeping firms

### Post 1: The Origin Story (Trust Builder)

Most people start a cybersecurity company because they see an opportunity.

I started mine because I watched a $500,000 ransomware attack destroy a business from the inside.

I was there. I saw the panic. The scrambling. The moment when leadership realized their backups weren't working.

That day changed everything for me.

24 years in IT taught me how to build networks. That one attack taught me why security has to come first, not second.

That's why Capital Cyber exists. We're not an IT company that bolts on security as an afterthought. We're a cybersecurity firm that happens to do IT.

There's a difference. And if you've ever been through a breach, you know exactly what I mean.

🔒 If you're a business owner wondering where you stand, let's talk. No sales pitch. Just an honest conversation.

### Post 2: Password Cracking Stat (Authority Builder)

In 2024, we cracked over 20,000 passwords.

Not because we're hackers. Because our clients hired us to test their defenses.

Here's what we found:

→ 73% of passwords followed predictable patterns
→ Company name + year was the #1 most common format
→ Most were cracked in under 60 seconds

Your employees aren't bad people. They're busy people. And busy people pick easy passwords.

The fix isn't yelling at your team. It's building systems that make weak passwords impossible.

If you want to know how many of your passwords we could crack, that's literally what we do.

### Post 3: CMMC Awareness (Education)

If you're a government contractor and you haven't heard of CMMC yet, this is your wake up call.

CMMC (Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification) is coming. The DoD is requiring it for contractors handling federal data. No certification = no contracts.

Here's what most contractors don't realize:

1. It's not just for big defense companies. Subcontractors need it too.
2. The assessment process takes months, not weeks.
3. Waiting until the last minute means paying rush fees and risking your contracts.

We've been helping manufacturers and construction companies get CMMC ready before the deadline hits.

The companies that start now will keep their contracts. The ones that wait will be scrambling.

Where does your company stand?

### Post 4: The Real Cost of Downtime (Problem Awareness)

A dental office lost 3 days of production last month because of a ransomware attack.

3 days.

No patient records. No scheduling system. No digital X-rays. Nothing.

Their "IT guy" had backups... on the same network that got encrypted.

The cost? About $47,000 in lost revenue. Plus the ransom demand. Plus the recovery. Plus the patients who never came back.

All preventable with basic cybersecurity hygiene that costs less than one day of downtime.

Your IT should be protecting your business, not just keeping the WiFi on.

### Post 5: CGA / Giving Back (Community)

Not every business can afford a cybersecurity assessment. That's the problem.

Small businesses are the #1 target for cyberattacks, but they're the least likely to have protection. It's not because they don't care. It's because the budget isn't there.

That's why I'm a board member at Cyber Grants Alliance. We provide free cybersecurity grants, including penetration testing, to businesses that need it most.

No strings attached. No upsell. Just protection.

If you know a small business that's been putting off cybersecurity because of cost, send them our way: cybergrantsalliance.org

Because keeping the nation safe means protecting ALL businesses, not just the ones with big budgets.

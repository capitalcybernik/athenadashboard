## Section 1: What Is CMMC 2.0?

### A Brief History

The Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) was created by the Department of Defense to address a persistent problem: sensitive defense information flowing through contractor networks that lacked adequate security controls.

The original CMMC 1.0 framework, introduced in 2020, defined five maturity levels with varying degrees of complexity. While well-intentioned, the model drew criticism from the defense industrial base for being overly burdensome, especially for small and mid-sized contractors.

In November 2021, the DoD announced CMMC 2.0, a streamlined revision that collapsed five levels into three, eliminated unique CMMC-specific practices, and aligned directly with existing NIST standards. The final rule (32 CFR Part 170) was published in October 2024, with enforcement beginning in 2025.

### Why CMMC Exists

The DoD supply chain is a prime target for nation-state adversaries. Every year, billions of dollars worth of intellectual property, weapons system designs, and operational data are compromised through contractor networks. CMMC exists to set a verifiable floor for cybersecurity across every organization that handles federal contract information or controlled unclassified information.

Put simply: if you work with the DoD, you must prove your cybersecurity posture. Self-attestation alone is no longer sufficient for most contractors.

### Who It Affects

CMMC applies to all organizations within the Defense Industrial Base (DIB), including:

- **Prime contractors** holding DoD contracts
- **Subcontractors** at any tier who handle FCI or CUI
- **Commercial product and service providers** whose offerings touch DoD data
- **IT and cloud service providers** supporting DIB organizations

If your contracts include DFARS clause 252.204-7012, 7019, 7020, or 7021, CMMC applies to you.

## Section 2: The Three Levels Explained

### Level 1: Foundational

- **Controls:** 17 practices based on FAR 52.204-21
- **Data type:** Federal Contract Information (FCI)
- **Assessment:** Annual self-assessment
- **Who needs it:** Contractors who handle FCI but not CUI

Level 1 covers basic cyber hygiene: using antivirus, limiting physical access, using unique passwords, and similar foundational controls. If your only obligation is protecting FCI, this is your target.

**Key point:** Self-assessments must be submitted to the Supplier Performance Risk System (SPRS) with an annual affirmation by a senior company official.

### Level 2: Advanced

- **Controls:** 110 practices from NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2
- **Data type:** Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)
- **Assessment:** Third-party assessment by a C3PAO (for critical contracts) or self-assessment (for select contracts)
- **Who needs it:** Contractors who handle CUI

This is where the majority of DIB contractors will land. Level 2 requires full implementation of all 110 NIST 800-171 controls, a complete System Security Plan (SSP), and either a self-assessment or a formal evaluation by a CMMC Third-Party Assessment Organization (C3PAO).

**Key point:** Even if your contract only requires a self-assessment at Level 2, the DoD can still audit your score. Inflated SPRS scores carry legal risk under the False Claims Act.

### Level 3: Expert

- **Controls:** 110 NIST 800-171 controls plus 24 selected controls from NIST SP 800-172
- **Data type:** CUI associated with critical programs
- **Assessment:** Government-led assessment by DIBCAC
- **Who needs it:** Contractors supporting the highest-priority DoD programs

Level 3 is reserved for contractors working on the most sensitive programs. The assessment is conducted directly by the Defense Industrial Base Cybersecurity Assessment Center (DIBCAC), and the bar is significantly higher.

### Which Level Do I Need?

Use this decision guide:

1. **Do you handle CUI?**
   - No → You likely need **Level 1**
   - Yes → Continue to question 2

2. **Does your contract involve critical national security information or priority programs?**
   - No → You likely need **Level 2**
   - Yes → You likely need **Level 3**

3. **Not sure if your data qualifies as CUI?**
   - Review your contract for references to DFARS 252.204-7012
   - Check if your data falls under any CUI category in the National Archives CUI Registry
   - Ask your prime contractor or contracting officer

**Pro tip:** When in doubt, prepare for Level 2. It covers the full NIST 800-171 control set and positions you for the broadest range of DoD opportunities.

## Section 3: The Four-Phase Rollout Timeline

CMMC 2.0 is rolling out in four phases, each expanding the scope of contracts that require certification.

### Phase 1 (Starting Q1 2025)

**What happens:** CMMC requirements begin appearing in new DoD solicitations and contracts.

- Level 1 self-assessments required where specified
- Level 2 self-assessments required where specified
- Contractors must have a current SPRS score on file
- Senior official must sign an annual affirmation of compliance

**Your action:** Ensure your SPRS score is accurate and current. Begin self-assessment preparation immediately.

### Phase 2 (Starting Q1 2026)

**What happens:** Third-party assessments (C3PAOs) become required for applicable Level 2 contracts.

- New contracts requiring Level 2 certification will mandate C3PAO assessments
- Level 3 requirements begin appearing in select contracts
- The Cyber AB ecosystem of assessors is fully operational

**Your action:** If you handle CUI, engage a C3PAO or compliance partner now. Assessment scheduling lead times can stretch 3 to 6 months or longer.

### Phase 3 (Starting Q1 2027)

**What happens:** CMMC requirements expand to all applicable DoD contracts, including exercised option periods.

- Broader inclusion of CMMC clauses across the acquisition portfolio
- Existing contracts with option periods may incorporate CMMC requirements

**Your action:** No contract is "safe" from CMMC at this stage. Full compliance must be in place.

### Phase 4 (Starting Q1 2028)

**What happens:** Full inclusion of CMMC in all DoD contracts involving FCI or CUI.

- CMMC is a standard requirement across the defense acquisition lifecycle
- Non-compliant contractors are effectively locked out of DoD work

**Your action:** This is the finish line. If you are not certified by this point, you cannot compete for DoD contracts requiring CMMC.

### Timeline at a Glance

| Phase | Start    | Key Milestone                                    |
|-------|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Q1 2025  | Self-assessments in new contracts                |
| 2     | Q1 2026  | C3PAO assessments required; Level 3 begins       |
| 3     | Q1 2027  | Expansion to option periods and broader contracts |
| 4     | Q1 2028  | Full CMMC inclusion across all applicable contracts |

## Section 4: CMMC Readiness Self-Assessment Checklist

This is the section that can save you thousands in consulting fees. Work through each control family honestly. For every question, mark **Yes**, **No**, or **Partial**. A "Partial" means you have something in place but it is incomplete or inconsistent.

## Section 5: The 10 Most Common Compliance Gaps

After conducting hundreds of assessments across the DIB, these are the gaps we see again and again. If any of these sound familiar, you are not alone, and they are all fixable.

### Gap 1: No Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

**What it is:** Users access CUI systems with only a username and password.

**Why it matters:** MFA is required for all accounts accessing CUI systems. Passwords alone are trivially compromised through phishing, credential stuffing, and brute force attacks. This is one of the first things assessors check.

**How to fix it:** Deploy MFA across all user accounts, starting with privileged accounts and remote access. Use phishing-resistant methods (hardware tokens or authenticator apps) rather than SMS-based codes. Most identity providers (Azure AD/Entra ID, Okta, Duo) support rapid MFA rollout.

### Gap 2: No Encryption at Rest

**What it is:** CUI stored on laptops, servers, or cloud platforms is not encrypted.

**Why it matters:** If a device is lost, stolen, or improperly decommissioned, unencrypted CUI is immediately exposed. NIST 800-171 requires FIPS 140-2 validated encryption for CUI at rest.

**How to fix it:** Enable BitLocker (Windows) or FileVault (Mac) on all endpoints. For servers and cloud storage, use platform-native encryption with FIPS-validated modules. Verify that encryption keys are managed securely and separately from the data they protect.

### Gap 3: Missing or Incomplete System Security Plan (SSP)

**What it is:** The organization lacks a documented SSP, or the one they have is a boilerplate template that does not reflect their actual environment.

**Why it matters:** The SSP is the foundational document for your CMMC assessment. It describes your CUI boundary, the systems in scope, and how each of the 110 controls is implemented. Without an accurate SSP, you cannot pass an assessment.

**How to fix it:** Build your SSP from the ground up based on your actual environment. Document each control with specifics: what tool, what configuration, what process, and who is responsible. Review and update it quarterly.

### Gap 4: Using Commercial Microsoft 365 Instead of GCC High

**What it is:** The organization processes CUI in standard commercial Microsoft 365 (or Google Workspace) instead of a FedRAMP Moderate-authorized environment.

**Why it matters:** Commercial cloud services do not meet the FedRAMP Moderate baseline required for processing, storing, or transmitting CUI. This is a systemic gap that affects email, file storage, collaboration, and more.

**How to fix it:** Migrate to Microsoft 365 GCC High (or another FedRAMP Moderate-authorized platform). Plan for a 60 to 90 day migration timeline, including license procurement, tenant configuration, data migration, and user training.

### Gap 5: No Formal Incident Response Plan

**What it is:** The organization has no documented process for detecting, responding to, and recovering from cyber incidents.

**Why it matters:** Without a plan, incidents escalate, evidence is lost, and required reporting timelines are missed. DoD contracts require incident reporting to DC3 within 72 hours.

**How to fix it:** Develop a written incident response plan covering roles, procedures, communication chains, and recovery steps. Test it at least annually through a tabletop exercise. Assign a specific individual as the incident response lead.

### Gap 6: Inadequate Access Controls

**What it is:** Users have more access than their roles require. Administrator privileges are widespread. Shared accounts are common.

**Why it matters:** Excessive access increases the blast radius of any compromise. Shared accounts make it impossible to maintain accountability and audit trails.

**How to fix it:** Implement role-based access control (RBAC). Conduct a privilege audit, removing unnecessary admin rights. Eliminate all shared accounts. Review access permissions quarterly.

### Gap 7: No Vulnerability Management Program

**What it is:** Systems are not regularly scanned for vulnerabilities, and patches are applied inconsistently or not at all.

**Why it matters:** Known vulnerabilities are the primary entry point for attackers. NIST 800-171 requires regular vulnerability scanning and timely remediation.

**How to fix it:** Deploy a vulnerability scanning tool (Nessus, Qualys, Rapid7) and scan at least quarterly. Establish a patching cadence: critical patches within 14 days, high within 30 days. Track remediation in your POA&M.

### Gap 8: Insufficient Audit Logging

**What it is:** Security events are not logged, logs are not reviewed, or logs are not retained for the required period.

**Why it matters:** Without logs, you cannot detect intrusions, investigate incidents, or demonstrate compliance. Assessors will ask to see your logging infrastructure and review process.

**How to fix it:** Centralize logs using a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solution. Configure logging on all CUI systems for authentication events, access changes, and administrative actions. Establish a log review process (daily automated alerts, weekly manual reviews).

### Gap 9: No Security Awareness Training Program

**What it is:** Employees do not receive regular cybersecurity training, or training is a one-time onboarding checkbox.

**Why it matters:** Humans are the most common attack vector. Phishing, social engineering, and accidental data exposure are preventable with consistent training.

**How to fix it:** Implement a security awareness program with monthly phishing simulations and at least annual comprehensive training. Track completion rates and follow up with individuals who fail simulations. Use a platform like KnowBe4, Proofpoint, or similar.

### Gap 10: Incomplete or Nonexistent POA&M

**What it is:** The organization has no Plan of Action and Milestones document, or it exists but is not actively maintained.

**Why it matters:** A POA&M is required to track known deficiencies and your plan for remediating them. Assessors expect to see an active, maintained POA&M with realistic timelines and assigned owners.

**How to fix it:** Create a POA&M that lists every known gap, assigns an owner, sets a remediation deadline, and tracks progress. Review it monthly. A POA&M is not a sign of weakness; it is a sign of maturity and honest self-assessment.

## Section 6: Your CMMC Readiness Roadmap

### Days 1 to 90: Assess and Plan

This phase is about understanding where you stand and building your plan.

**Week 1 to 2: Scope Definition**
- Identify all systems, networks, and locations where CUI is processed, stored, or transmitted
- Map your CUI data flows from receipt through storage to disposal
- Define your CUI boundary (the systems in scope for CMMC)

**Week 3 to 4: Gap Assessment**
- Complete the self-assessment checklist in Section 4 of this guide
- Score your current state against all 110 NIST 800-171 controls (for Level 2)
- Calculate your preliminary SPRS score
- Document all gaps in an initial POA&M

**Week 5 to 8: Prioritize and Plan**
- Rank gaps by risk and remediation effort
- Identify quick wins (items fixable in under 30 days with minimal investment)
- Develop a remediation budget and timeline
- Assign an internal CMMC lead or compliance point of contact

**Week 9 to 12: Quick Wins**
- Enable MFA on all accounts
- Activate encryption at rest on all endpoints
- Disable unnecessary services and ports
- Begin security awareness training
- Draft or update your System Security Plan

**Milestone:** By day 90, you should have a clear picture of your compliance posture, an accurate SPRS score, and a prioritized remediation roadmap.

### Months 4 to 6: Remediate Core Gaps

This phase is about closing the gaps that matter most.

- Migrate to GCC High or another FedRAMP Moderate-authorized cloud environment (if applicable)
- Deploy centralized logging and a SIEM solution
- Implement a formal vulnerability management program with regular scanning
- Establish and document your incident response plan
- Conduct your first tabletop exercise
- Implement role-based access controls and eliminate shared accounts
- Complete your SSP with control-by-control implementation details
- Begin formal security awareness training with phishing simulations

**Milestone:** By month 6, your major technical and procedural gaps should be closed or actively in remediation with documented timelines.

### Months 7 to 12: Validate and Certify

This phase is about proving your compliance and preparing for assessment.

- Conduct an internal assessment or hire a compliance partner for a pre-assessment review
- Remediate any findings from the pre-assessment
- Finalize and review your SSP, POA&M, and all supporting documentation
- Submit your SPRS score and annual affirmation
- Engage a C3PAO and schedule your formal assessment (if required)
- Conduct a final readiness review 30 days before your scheduled assessment
- Complete your C3PAO assessment

**Milestone:** By month 12, you should be assessment-ready or certified.

### When to Engage a Compliance Partner

Consider bringing in outside expertise if:

- You do not have dedicated cybersecurity staff
- Your SPRS score is below 70 (out of 110)
- You need to migrate to GCC High and have never done it before
- You are unsure how to scope your CUI boundary
- You want a pre-assessment review before engaging a C3PAO
- Your timeline is tight and you cannot afford trial and error

A good compliance partner does not just hand you a checklist. They work alongside your team to build sustainable security practices that survive the assessment and actually protect your business.

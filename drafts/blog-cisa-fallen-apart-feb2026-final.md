# CISA Has Lost a Third of Its Workforce. Here's What That Means for Your Business.

The agency responsible for protecting American businesses from cyberattacks is falling apart. And if you're a small or mid-sized business, you need to understand what that means for you.

## What Happened to CISA?

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has lost roughly a third of its workforce over the past year. Entire divisions have been shut down. Senior leaders in counter-ransomware, threat hunting, and secure software development have left. Programs that helped businesses detect threats and share intelligence have been cut or left in limbo.

This isn't speculation. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are saying the same thing.

Republican Congressman Andrew Garbarino, who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, put it plainly: *"A lot of the best and brightest have left the agency... it definitely leaves us all vulnerable."*

Democrat Bennie Thompson echoed the concern: *"We are weaker because of CISA's lack of manpower."*

When both parties agree something is broken, it's broken.

## What CISA Used to Do for Businesses

Most business owners have never heard of CISA, but the agency played a critical role behind the scenes.

They coordinated threat intelligence between the federal government and private sector, warning about emerging cyberattacks before they spread. They maintained vulnerability databases and alerts so security teams could patch systems in time. When organizations got hit, CISA provided guidance and resources to help contain the damage. They deployed sensors and monitoring across energy, healthcare, financial, and government networks. And two key information sharing centers that served state and local governments have already folded.

That safety net is fraying. Fast.

## Why This Matters to Small and Mid-Sized Businesses

Large enterprises have their own security operations centers, dedicated teams, and million dollar budgets. When a federal agency scales back, they absorb the gap.

Small and mid-sized businesses can't.

If you run a CPA firm, a manufacturing company, a mortgage business, or a government contracting operation, you were already a target. Ransomware groups don't care about your revenue. They care about whether your defenses are weak enough to get through.

Now remove the federal agency that was helping coordinate the response to those threats. The result is more attacks, less warning, and fewer resources available when something goes wrong.

## The Private Sector Has to Step Up

The CyberScoop report noted that organizations previously turning to CISA for help are now seeking alternatives: industry alliances, outside consultants, and direct partnerships.

This is the new reality. Businesses that relied on government resources for cybersecurity guidance need to build those capabilities on their own, or find a partner who already has them.

That's exactly what we do at Capital Cyber.

## What Capital Cyber Provides That CISA Can't Anymore

We're not replacing a federal agency. But we are filling the gap for the businesses that need it most.

**24/7 Security Operations Center (SOC).** We monitor your systems around the clock. We're not waiting for a government alert that may never come.

**Proactive threat hunting.** We don't sit back and wait for attacks to happen. We actively look for signs of compromise before damage is done.

**Vulnerability management.** Regular scanning, patching, and hardening across every device and system we manage.

**Incident response.** If something goes wrong, we're on it immediately. Not a government hotline. A team that already knows your environment.

**Compliance support.** For government contractors navigating CMMC, CPAs meeting IRS safeguard requirements, and healthcare organizations under HIPAA, we keep you compliant and protected at the same time.

## The Bottom Line

The federal government's cybersecurity capacity is shrinking. That's not a political opinion. It's a fact acknowledged by leaders in both parties.

If your business depends on the assumption that someone else is watching your back, it's time to rethink that.

The threats haven't slowed down. If anything, they're picking up speed. The only question is whether you'll have a partner in your corner when they arrive.

In 2024, we cracked over 20,000 passwords.

Not because we're hackers. Because our clients hired us to test their defenses.

Here's what we found:

→ 73% of passwords followed predictable patterns
→ Company name + year was the #1 most common format
→ Most were cracked in under 60 seconds

Your employees aren't bad people. They're busy people. And busy people pick easy passwords.

The fix isn't yelling at your team. It's building systems that make weak passwords impossible.

If you want to know how many of your passwords we could crack, that's literally what we do.

Most people start a cybersecurity company because they see an opportunity.

I started mine because I watched a $500,000 ransomware attack destroy a business from the inside.

I was there. I saw the panic. The scrambling. The moment when leadership realized their backups weren't working.

That day changed everything for me.

24 years in IT taught me how to build networks. That one attack taught me why security has to come first, not second.

That's why Capital Cyber exists. We're not an IT company that bolts on security as an afterthought. We're a cybersecurity firm that happens to do IT.

There's a difference. And if you've ever been through a breach, you know exactly what I mean.

🔒 If you're a business owner wondering where you stand, let's talk. No sales pitch. Just an honest conversation.

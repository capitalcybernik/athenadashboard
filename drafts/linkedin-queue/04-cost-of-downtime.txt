A small business lost 3 days of production last month because of a ransomware attack.

3 days.

No client records. No scheduling system. No email. Nothing.

Their "IT guy" had backups... on the same network that got encrypted.

The cost? About $47,000 in lost revenue. Plus the ransom demand. Plus the recovery. Plus the clients who never came back.

All preventable with basic cybersecurity practices that cost less than one day of downtime.

Your IT should be protecting your business, not just keeping the WiFi on.

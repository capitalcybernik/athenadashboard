# CMMC 2.0 Phase 1 Is Live: What Manufacturing & Construction Contractors Need to Know

CMMC enforcement started November 10, 2025. If you're a manufacturer or construction company in the defense supply chain, this isn't a future problem anymore. It's happening now.

Phase 1 is already being written into new DoD solicitations. Phase 2 hits November 2026. Full implementation wraps by November 2028. The window to get ready is shrinking fast.

Here's what you actually need to know and do.

## What Changed on November 10th

The Department of Defense began including CMMC requirements (DFARS 252.204-7025) in new contract solicitations. That means:

**You cannot win new defense contracts without proving CMMC compliance.**

Phase 1 requires Level 1 self-assessments. You must affirm compliance with 15 security requirements from FAR clause 52.204-21 and report your results in the Supplier Performance Risk System (SPRS).

If you haven't submitted your self-assessment to SPRS, you are already behind.

## The Three Levels (Quick Version)

**Level 1:** 15 basic security practices. Self-assessment. Required now for contracts involving Federal Contract Information (FCI).

**Level 2:** 110 controls from NIST SP 800-171. Third-party assessment required for most contractors handling Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). This is where most manufacturers and construction firms will land.

**Level 3:** 134 controls based on NIST SP 800-172. Government-led assessment. Reserved for the most sensitive programs.

Most companies reading this need Level 2. That's 110 controls covering access management, incident response, audit logging, encryption, physical security, and more.

## Why Manufacturing & Construction Gets Hit Hardest

Large defense primes have had cybersecurity programs for years. But the supply chain? That's where the gaps are.

If you're a machine shop making parts for a defense prime, you handle CUI. Technical drawings, specifications, tolerances, material requirements. All of it qualifies.

If you're a construction firm building on a military installation, you're handling facility layouts, security specifications, and project details that fall under CUI.

Most of these companies have never had a formal cybersecurity program. An antivirus subscription and a firewall don't come close to covering 110 NIST controls.

## The DOJ Factor

Here's the part that should get your attention. The Department of Justice's Civil Cyber Fraud Initiative is actively going after contractors who falsely claim CMMC compliance. They've already announced settlements and enforcement actions.

If you self-assess and affirm compliance in SPRS but can't actually back it up, you're exposed to False Claims Act liability. That means treble damages and potential debarment from government contracting.

Don't check the box unless you can prove it.

## Your Compliance Checklist (Start Here)

**Right now:**
☐ Determine if your contracts involve FCI or CUI
☐ Complete your Level 1 self-assessment (15 controls)
☐ Submit your score to SPRS
☐ Identify who in your organization is responsible for compliance

**Before November 2026 (Phase 2):**
☐ Conduct a full gap assessment against NIST SP 800-171 (110 controls)
☐ Develop your System Security Plan (SSP) and Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M)
☐ Implement required controls (encryption, MFA, access management, incident response, etc.)
☐ Engage a C3PAO for third-party assessment if Level 2 is required
☐ Train your workforce on handling CUI

**Ongoing:**
☐ Annual self-assessments and affirmations
☐ Continuous monitoring and incident response readiness
☐ Flow-down requirements to your subcontractors

## The Bottom Line

Phase 1 is live. Phase 2 is less than nine months away. Every month you wait makes this harder and more expensive.

The manufacturers and construction firms that move now will lock in contracts while their competitors scramble. The ones that wait will watch those contracts disappear.

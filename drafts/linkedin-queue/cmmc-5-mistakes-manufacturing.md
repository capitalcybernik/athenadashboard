# 5 Critical CMMC Compliance Mistakes That Cost Manufacturing & Construction Firms Their Defense Contracts

If your company builds, machines, or assembles anything for the Department of Defense, CMMC compliance isn't optional anymore. It's the price of admission.

The Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) is now being written into DoD contracts. If you can't prove your cybersecurity meets the standard, you lose the contract. Period.

After working with dozens of manufacturers and construction firms navigating this process, here are the five mistakes I see most often — and every one of them can cost you a contract.

## 1. Treating CMMC Like an IT Checklist

Most manufacturers hand CMMC to their IT guy and say "handle it." That's like asking your accountant to run your safety program.

CMMC isn't just about firewalls and antivirus. It covers 110 security controls across 14 domains — access control, incident response, risk management, physical security, and more. Your IT team manages your network. CMMC requires a comprehensive security program that touches every department, every process, and every person who handles controlled unclassified information (CUI).

**The fix:** Assign a dedicated compliance lead or partner with a cybersecurity firm that specializes in CMMC. This is too big for a side project.

## 2. Not Knowing Where Your CUI Lives

Here's a conversation I have almost weekly:

"Do you handle CUI?"
"Probably not."
"Do you receive technical drawings, specifications, or engineering data from your prime contractor?"
"Oh, yeah. All the time."

That's CUI. And if you don't know exactly where it's stored, who has access, and how it's transmitted, you're already out of compliance.

Most manufacturing and construction firms have CUI scattered across email inboxes, shared drives, personal laptops, and sometimes even paper files on the shop floor.

**The fix:** Conduct a thorough data flow analysis before you do anything else. Map every system that touches CUI. You can't protect what you can't find.

## 3. Assuming Your MSP Has You Covered

Your managed service provider keeps your computers running. That's great. But most MSPs are not equipped to implement the full scope of CMMC controls.

CMMC Level 2 requires compliance with all 110 controls from NIST SP 800-171. That includes things like FIPS-validated encryption, multi-factor authentication on all CUI systems, continuous monitoring, vulnerability scanning, and documented incident response plans. Many MSPs don't offer these services, and some don't even know what NIST 800-171 requires.

**The fix:** Work with a cybersecurity firm that lives and breathes CMMC and NIST compliance. Your MSP can still manage your day-to-day IT, but compliance needs a specialist.

## 4. Waiting Until the Contract Requires It

"We'll deal with CMMC when it shows up in our contracts."

By then, it's too late. CMMC assessments take months of preparation. You need to identify gaps, implement controls, document policies, train staff, and often upgrade infrastructure. Rushing this process leads to failed assessments and lost contracts.

Your competitors who started early? They'll be certified and winning contracts while you're still scrambling to write your System Security Plan.

**The fix:** Start now. Even a gap assessment gives you a roadmap and timeline. You don't need to be perfect today — you need to be moving.

## 5. Ignoring Subcontractor Flow-Down Requirements

CMMC doesn't stop at your door. If you're a prime contractor, your subcontractors need to be compliant too. If you're a sub, your prime is going to start asking questions you need to be ready to answer.

Construction firms are especially vulnerable here. Projects involve dozens of subcontractors, many of them small shops without any cybersecurity program. One weak link in the supply chain can jeopardize the entire contract.

**The fix:** Start the conversation with your supply chain now. Help your subs understand what's coming. Better yet, connect them with resources that can help them get compliant without breaking the bank.

## The Bottom Line

CMMC compliance isn't going away, and enforcement is ramping up through 2026. Manufacturing and construction firms in the defense supply chain have a narrow window to get this right.

The companies that act now will lock in contracts. The ones that wait will watch those contracts go to their competitors.

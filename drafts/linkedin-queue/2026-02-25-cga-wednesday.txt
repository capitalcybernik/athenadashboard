Every week I hear from small business owners who want to improve their cybersecurity but don't know where to start — or how to pay for it.

That's exactly why I joined the board at Cyber Grants Alliance.

CGA provides free cybersecurity grants to small businesses. Real funding. No catch.

Here's what a grant can cover:
→ A security assessment to find your gaps
→ Tools to protect your email and network
→ Training so your team knows what to watch for

You don't need a big budget to get started. You just need to apply.

Not every business can afford a cybersecurity assessment. That's the problem.

Small businesses are the #1 target for cyberattacks, but they're the least likely to have protection. It's not because they don't care. It's because the budget isn't there.

That's why I'm a board member at Cyber Grants Alliance. We provide free cybersecurity grants to businesses that need it most.

No strings attached. No upsell. Just protection.

If you know a small business that's been putting off cybersecurity because of cost, send them our way: cybergrantsalliance.org

Because keeping the nation safe means protecting ALL businesses, not just the ones with big budgets.

# CMMC 2.0 Four-Phase Rollout: What DoD Contractors Need to Know (2025 to 2028)

The Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) program is no longer a "someday" concern. As of November 10, 2025, the CMMC Final Rule is in effect, and the Department of Defense has begun rolling out cybersecurity certification requirements across its contracting ecosystem.

If your company handles DoD contracts, whether as a prime or a subcontractor, this affects you. Here is a clear breakdown of what the four-phase rollout means, what each CMMC level requires, and what you should be doing right now.

## A Quick Refresher: What Is CMMC 2.0?

CMMC 2.0 is the DoD's unified framework for ensuring that companies in the defense industrial base (DIB) are protecting sensitive information. It evolved from the original CMMC 1.0 (released in 2020), which drew criticism for being overly complex and costly for small businesses. After a comprehensive review, the DoD streamlined the program into three levels and reintroduced self-assessments for lower-risk contracts.

The bottom line: if you process, store, or transmit Federal Contract Information (FCI) or Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) as part of a DoD contract, you will need to meet a specific CMMC level to win and keep that work.

## Understanding the Three CMMC Levels

Before diving into the phases, it helps to understand what each level requires.

**Level 1: Foundational** applies to companies that handle FCI (but not CUI). It requires compliance with 15 basic cybersecurity practices drawn from FAR 52.204-21. Think of these as fundamental cyber hygiene: using antivirus, limiting access to authorized users, and similar baseline controls. Level 1 is verified through annual self-assessment.

**Level 2: Advanced** applies to companies that handle CUI. It aligns with the 110 security controls in NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2. This is where most DoD contractors will land. Depending on the sensitivity of the CUI involved, Level 2 may require either a self-assessment or a third-party certification assessment conducted by a CMMC Third-Party Assessment Organization (C3PAO).

**Level 3: Expert** is reserved for the most sensitive programs and the highest-value targets in the supply chain. It builds on Level 2 by adding controls from NIST SP 800-172. Level 3 assessments are conducted by the government itself, specifically the Defense Contract Management Agency's Defense Industrial Base Cybersecurity Assessment Center (DIBCAC).

## The Four-Phase Rollout: Your Timeline

The DoD is not flipping the switch all at once. Instead, CMMC requirements are being phased into contracts over a three-year period. Here is what each phase looks like.

### Phase 1: November 10, 2025 to November 10, 2026

Phase 1 is happening now. During this period, the CMMC Program Office has discretion to include Level 1 or Level 2 self-assessment requirements in new DoD solicitations and contracts. The key word here is "discretion." Not every contract will include CMMC requirements immediately, but some already do.

What this means practically: if you are bidding on new DoD work, you may encounter CMMC self-assessment requirements in the solicitation. You need to have completed your self-assessment and posted your score to the Supplier Performance Risk System (SPRS) before contract award.

Even if you have not seen it in a solicitation yet, do not assume you have time. Contracting officers are beginning to include these requirements, and the pace will accelerate throughout Phase 1.

### Phase 2: November 10, 2026 to November 9, 2027

Phase 2 raises the bar significantly. Starting in late 2026, all applicable new contracts involving CUI will require Level 2 certification assessments conducted by an accredited C3PAO. Self-assessments will no longer be sufficient for contracts that require third-party certification.

This applies to both prime contractors and subcontractors. If your prime requires you to handle CUI, you need to be certified before the contract can be awarded.

Here is the challenge: the pool of accredited C3PAOs is limited, and demand will surge as Phase 2 approaches. If you wait until mid-2026 to start your certification journey, you may not be able to schedule an assessment in time. The assessment process itself can take months, not counting the remediation work you may need to do beforehand.

### Phase 3: November 10, 2027 to November 9, 2028

Phase 3 expands the requirements further. Level 2 C3PAO assessments will now be required not just for new contract awards but also for the exercise of option periods on existing contracts. This means that even contracts you already hold could be affected when options come up for renewal.

Additionally, Phase 3 introduces Level 3 (DIBCAC) assessment requirements for contracts involving the most sensitive programs. If your work touches higher-sensitivity CUI or critical defense programs, the government will conduct your assessment directly.

The practical impact: you cannot rely on grandfathered status from older contracts. When your option period arrives during Phase 3, you will need to demonstrate current certification.

### Phase 4: November 10, 2028 and Beyond

Phase 4 is full implementation. Every DoD contract (except those solely for commercial off-the-shelf items) that involves processing, storing, or transmitting FCI or CUI must include the appropriate CMMC level as a condition of award. No exceptions, no discretion. CMMC becomes a universal requirement for doing business with the Department of Defense.

By this point, if you are not certified at the required level, you are effectively locked out of DoD contracting.

## What Should You Do Right Now?

If you are reading this and thinking "we should probably get started," you are right. Here is a practical action plan.

**Determine your CMMC level.** Review your current and anticipated DoD contracts. Do you handle only FCI, or do you also handle CUI? The answer determines whether you need Level 1 or Level 2. If you are unsure what type of information flows through your systems, that is a gap worth closing immediately.

**Conduct a NIST SP 800-171 gap assessment.** If you need Level 2, your controls need to align with all 110 requirements in NIST SP 800-171. A gap assessment identifies where you fall short and gives you a roadmap for remediation. This is not something you want to rush through the month before your C3PAO assessment.

**Build and maintain your System Security Plan (SSP) and Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M).** These documents are essential for both self-assessments and third-party certifications. Your SSP describes how your organization meets each control. Your POA&M outlines the gaps you have identified and your timeline for closing them. Under CMMC 2.0, you can have a limited number of open POA&M items at the time of assessment, but they must be resolved within 180 days.

**Post your SPRS score.** Your self-assessment score must be entered into SPRS. If you have not done this yet, it needs to happen before you bid on any contract that includes CMMC requirements.

**Get on a C3PAO's calendar early.** If you anticipate needing a third-party certification (which most CUI-handling contractors will by Phase 2), start engaging with C3PAOs now. Assessment slots will fill up fast as deadlines approach. Starting the conversation early gives you time to remediate issues and schedule your assessment without panic.

**Do not overlook your subcontractors.** CMMC flows down. If your subcontractors handle FCI or CUI, they need to meet the appropriate CMMC level too. Start those conversations now so their compliance gaps do not become your contracting risk.

**Consider working with a cybersecurity partner.** Navigating CMMC compliance while running your business is a heavy lift, especially for small and mid-size contractors. A firm that specializes in CMMC readiness can accelerate your timeline, help you avoid common pitfalls, and give you confidence heading into your assessment.

## The Clock Is Ticking

CMMC 2.0 has been talked about for years. Now it is here. The phased rollout gives contractors a window to prepare, but that window is narrowing. Phase 1 is already underway, and Phase 2 (with its third-party certification requirement) is less than a year away.

The contractors who start now will be positioned to win work. The ones who wait will be scrambling for assessment slots, rushing through remediation, and potentially losing contracts they would otherwise have won.

Do not let compliance become a crisis. Start today.

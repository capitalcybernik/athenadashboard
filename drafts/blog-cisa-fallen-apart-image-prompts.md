## Notes for Anup
- Generate images using Midjourney, DALL-E, or Adobe Firefly
- Avoid overly "techy" or sci-fi looking images (no floating holograms, no Matrix green text)
- Go for editorial/journalism feel since this is based on a real news story
- Compress all images for web (under 200KB each)
- Featured image is most important; the section images are optional depending on post length on the site

CISA has lost a third of its workforce in the past year.

Entire divisions shut down. Senior leaders in ransomware response, threat hunting, and secure software development gone. Two information sharing centers that served state and local governments? Folded.

This isn't a partisan talking point. Republican and Democrat lawmakers are saying the same thing: the agency is significantly diminished.

Here's what that means if you run a business:

The federal safety net for cybersecurity is getting thinner. The threat intelligence sharing, vulnerability alerts, and incident support that CISA provided? Scaled back or gone.

Meanwhile, ransomware attacks aren't slowing down. They're accelerating.

Large enterprises can absorb this. They have dedicated security teams and eight figure budgets.

Small and mid-sized businesses can't.

If you're a CPA firm, a government contractor, a manufacturer, or a mortgage company, you need to stop assuming someone else is watching your back.

The organizations that previously relied on CISA are now turning to private sector partners. That shift is already happening.

At Capital Cyber, this is exactly what we do. 24/7 monitoring, proactive threat hunting, compliance support, and incident response for the businesses that need it most.

The government can't be your cybersecurity plan anymore. You need a real partner.

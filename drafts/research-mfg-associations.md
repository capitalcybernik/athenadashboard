# Research: 3 Manufacturing & Construction Industry Associations
## For CGA/Capital Cyber CMMC Partnership Outreach

---

## 1. NIST MEP National Network (via GENEDGE — Virginia's MEP Center)

**Why this matters:** GENEDGE is Virginia's own MEP Center and already leads a $1M federal cybersecurity program for manufacturers. They serve 200+ companies per year and are specifically funded to help small/medium manufacturers with CMMC and cybersecurity readiness. This is the #1 partnership target.

- **Website:** https://genedge.org
- **NIST Profile:** https://www.nist.gov/mep/centers/genedge
- **Location:** Martinsville, VA (serves all of Virginia)
- **Network Size:** MEP National Network has ~475 service locations nationwide
- **Cybersecurity Focus:** Leading a regional cybersecurity program with federal funding; helps SMMs with CMMC/NIST 800-171 compliance
- **Key Contact:** Jordan Howard (AGC federal contracts/cybersecurity lead) — jordan.howard@agc.org / (703) 837-5368
- **NIST MEP Cybersecurity Lead:** Celia Paulsen (referenced in NAM articles)
- **Partnership Angle:** CGA could partner as a grant provider for manufacturers GENEDGE identifies as needing pen testing/assessments but lacking budget. GENEDGE refers → CGA funds the pen test → Capital Cyber executes → 20% convert.
- **Outreach Template:** "GENEDGE is already helping VA manufacturers with cybersecurity. CGA can supplement with free pen testing grants for your members who can't afford assessments."

## 2. Associated General Contractors of America (AGC)

**Why this matters:** AGC is THE national association for construction contractors, including thousands of defense/federal contractors who need CMMC compliance. They already have a dedicated CMMC resource page and run webinars on compliance — they know their members need help.

- **Website:** https://www.agc.org
- **HQ:** Arlington, VA (right in Capital Cyber's backyard)
- **Membership:** 27,000+ member firms nationwide (general contractors, specialty contractors, service providers)
- **CMMC Page:** https://www.agc.org/cybersecurity-federal-contractors
- **Key Contact for Cybersecurity/CMMC:** Jordan Howard — jordan.howard@agc.org / (703) 837-5368
- **Phone:** (703) 837-5417 (general)
- **Chapter Opportunity:** AGC of Virginia chapter for local outreach
- **Partnership Angle:** AGC members doing federal construction MUST comply with CMMC. Many are small firms with no cybersecurity staff. CGA pen testing grants + Capital Cyber implementation is a perfect fit.
- **Outreach Template:** "Your members building for DoD face CMMC deadlines. CGA offers free cybersecurity assessments through grants — no cost to your members. Can we present at your next chapter meeting?"

## 3. National Association of Manufacturers (NAM)

**Why this matters:** NAM is the largest manufacturing trade association in the US with 14,000+ member companies. They've published extensively on CMMC and cybersecurity threats to manufacturers. They also launched "NAM Cyber Cover" (cyber insurance partnership) showing they take this seriously.

- **Website:** https://nam.org
- **HQ:** Washington, DC
- **Membership:** 14,000+ manufacturing companies across every industrial sector
- **CMMC Coverage:** Multiple articles educating members on CMMC compliance requirements
- **Cyber Initiative:** NAM Cyber Cover (partnership with AHT and Coalition for cyber insurance)
- **Contact:** General inquiries via nam.org/contact; partnership inquiries through their membership team
- **Partnership Angle:** NAM members in the defense supply chain (aerospace, defense manufacturing, electronics) all need CMMC. CGA grants for free pen testing could be promoted through NAM's communications to members.
- **Outreach Template:** "NAM is already educating members on CMMC. CGA can help them take the next step with funded cybersecurity assessments — free pen tests for qualifying manufacturers."

## Recommended Priority
1. **GENEDGE (MEP)** — Highest priority. Virginia-based, already funded for cybersecurity, closest alignment with CGA mission. Warm outreach.
2. **AGC** — High priority. HQ in Arlington (local), dedicated CMMC contact (Jordan Howard), members desperately need compliance help.
3. **NAM** — Medium priority. Largest reach but harder to get partnership meetings at national level. Consider targeting NAM state affiliates first.

## Next Steps
- Draft outreach emails for all three
- Prioritize GENEDGE and AGC (local, direct contacts available)
- Prepare a one-pager: "CGA + [Association] CMMC Partnership" for each

### Newsletter Guidelines
- **Design:** Clean, minimal. No gradients, no colored boxes, no emoji headers. Looks like a real email from a person.
- **Tone:** Conversational. Written as Nikhil, not "The Capital Cyber Team."
- **Font:** Serif (Georgia). Simple text link CTAs, no big buttons.
- **CTA:** Link to book with Rick (capital-cyber.com/rick)
- **Sign off:** Nikhil Bon, Capital Cyber, (571) 410-3066
- **Template reference:** v3 humanized style is the standard going forward.

### Upcoming Newsletter Ideas
- CISA workforce collapse: what it means for small business (article drafted, blog ready)
- Tax season cybersecurity checklist for CPAs
- CMMC Phase 1 enforcement deadline reminder

# CMMC vs. ITAR: What Defense Manufacturers Need to Understand

*Published by Capital Cyber | Leesburg, VA | (571) 410 3066*

If your manufacturing company works on defense programs, you may be subject to both CMMC and ITAR requirements. These two frameworks overlap significantly, but they are not the same thing. Understanding where they converge, where they diverge, and how they compound each other is essential for any defense manufacturer navigating the compliance landscape in 2026.

Getting one right does not mean you have covered the other. And the penalties for getting either wrong range from lost contracts to criminal prosecution.

## What ITAR Covers

The International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) control the export and transfer of defense articles, defense services, and related technical data listed on the United States Munitions List (USML). ITAR is administered by the State Department's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC).

If your company manufactures items on the USML, provides services related to defense articles, or handles technical data associated with those items, you are subject to ITAR. This includes a vast range of manufacturing activities: firearms and ammunition, missiles and rockets, military vehicles, aircraft and related components, naval vessels, military electronics, and the technical data associated with all of these categories.

ITAR's core requirement is simple in concept: defense articles and technical data cannot be exported or transferred to foreign persons without proper authorization. In practice, this means controlling physical access to your facility, controlling digital access to technical data, tracking every transfer of controlled information, and maintaining detailed records of all activities involving controlled items.

## What CMMC Covers

CMMC focuses specifically on protecting Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) within the defense supply chain. It is based on NIST SP 800 171 (for Level 2) and requires defense contractors to implement specific cybersecurity controls and demonstrate that implementation through assessment.

While ITAR controls the export of defense articles and technical data, CMMC protects the broader category of CUI that includes but extends beyond ITAR controlled information. CUI encompasses technical drawings, manufacturing specifications, test data, procurement information, and many other data types that may or may not also be ITAR controlled.

## Where They Overlap

### Both Require Information Protection

ITAR and CMMC both require you to protect sensitive defense information from unauthorized access. Many of the same technical controls apply: access controls, encryption, network security, physical security, and personnel security.

If you implement CMMC Level 2 controls properly, you will address many of the cybersecurity aspects of ITAR compliance. Similarly, a strong ITAR compliance program provides a foundation for many CMMC controls.

### Both Require Access Control

ITAR restricts access to defense articles and technical data to authorized U.S. persons (unless a license or exemption applies). CMMC requires that CUI be accessible only to authorized individuals based on the principle of least privilege. Both frameworks demand that you know who has access to what, and that you limit that access appropriately.

### Both Require Training

ITAR requires that personnel handling controlled items understand their responsibilities. CMMC requires security awareness training for all personnel and role based training for those with security duties. A comprehensive training program can satisfy both requirements simultaneously.

### Both Require Incident Reporting

ITAR violations must be reported to DDTC through voluntary disclosures. CMMC (through DFARS 252.204 7012) requires reporting of cyber incidents to the DoD within 72 hours. Both frameworks demand that you have the capability to detect, investigate, and report security incidents.

## Where They Differ

### Regulatory Authority

ITAR is administered by the State Department under the Arms Export Control Act. CMMC is a Department of Defense procurement requirement implemented through DFARS clauses. Different agencies, different legal foundations, different enforcement mechanisms.

### Scope of Controlled Information

ITAR controls are specific to defense articles and technical data on the USML. CMMC protects all CUI, which is a broader category. You might handle CUI that is not ITAR controlled (such as general engineering specifications or procurement data), and you might handle ITAR controlled items that are not electronically stored CUI (such as physical defense articles). Your compliance program must address both scopes.

### Assessment and Verification

ITAR compliance is primarily self managed, with enforcement through DDTC audits, voluntary disclosures, and investigations triggered by suspected violations. CMMC requires formal third party assessment by a C3PAO for Level 2 certification. The verification mechanisms are fundamentally different.

### Penalties

This is where the difference becomes stark. ITAR violations carry criminal penalties including fines up to $1 million per violation and imprisonment up to 20 years. Civil penalties can reach $500,000 or more per violation. These penalties apply to individuals as well as organizations.

CMMC noncompliance results in inability to win or perform on DoD contracts, potential False Claims Act liability, and reputational damage. While the financial impact can be severe (losing all DoD revenue), CMMC noncompliance does not carry the criminal penalties that ITAR violations do.

### Foreign Person Access

ITAR specifically restricts access by foreign persons (non U.S. citizens, non permanent residents). CMMC does not have an explicit foreign person restriction, though many CUI categories implicitly limit foreign access. If you have foreign national employees, ITAR imposes specific obligations that CMMC alone does not address.

## The Compounding Challenge

Here is what makes compliance difficult for defense manufacturers: ITAR and CMMC are not alternative requirements. They are additive. If your manufacturing operation handles both ITAR controlled technical data and CUI, you must satisfy both frameworks simultaneously.

This creates compounding requirements in several areas:

**Access Control Complexity**

You need access controls that satisfy ITAR's foreign person restrictions AND CMMC's least privilege requirements. This may mean multiple layers of access control, different authorization processes for different data types, and more complex identity management.

**Documentation Burden**

ITAR requires specific records and documentation (technology control plans, export compliance procedures, transfer records). CMMC requires its own documentation (System Security Plan, POA&M, policies and procedures). While there is overlap, each framework has unique documentation requirements.

**Training Requirements**

Your training program must cover ITAR compliance (recognizing controlled items, understanding export restrictions, reporting violations) AND CMMC requirements (cybersecurity awareness, handling CUI, incident reporting). Personnel who handle both ITAR controlled data and CUI need comprehensive training that addresses both.

**Audit Readiness**

You must be prepared for DDTC audits, DIBCAC assessments, and C3PAO evaluations. Each has different scope, methodology, and expectations. Maintaining audit readiness for multiple frameworks requires disciplined program management.

## A Practical Approach for Defense Manufacturers

### Step 1: Understand Your Obligations

Determine which of your products, services, and data are ITAR controlled (on the USML) and which qualify as CUI. These categories may overlap but are not identical. Map both scopes clearly.

### Step 2: Build an Integrated Compliance Framework

Rather than maintaining separate programs for ITAR and CMMC, build an integrated compliance framework that addresses both. Many controls satisfy both requirements. Your access control system, encryption solution, training program, and incident response plan can be designed to meet the requirements of both frameworks with unified policies and procedures.

### Step 3: Prioritize the Highest Risk Areas

Criminal penalties make ITAR violations your highest risk area. Ensure that your ITAR compliance program is solid, especially regarding foreign person access controls, technology control plans, and export authorization procedures. Then layer CMMC controls on top to address the broader cybersecurity requirements.

### Step 4: Engage Qualified Expertise

The intersection of ITAR and CMMC requires expertise in both export controls and cybersecurity. General IT providers and generic compliance consultants rarely have both. Capital Cyber brings deep cybersecurity expertise and understanding of the defense manufacturing environment, including the regulatory complexities that defense manufacturers face.

### Step 5: Document the Relationship

Your System Security Plan and supporting documentation should clearly identify which data is ITAR controlled, which is CUI, and which falls under both categories. This clarity helps assessors understand your compliance approach and helps your team apply the right controls to the right data.

## The Bottom Line

ITAR and CMMC are both mandatory for defense manufacturers who handle controlled defense information. Neither framework satisfies the other completely. The manufacturers who succeed are those who understand both requirements, build integrated compliance programs, and maintain disciplined execution across both frameworks.

The consequences of failure are severe on both sides. ITAR violations can result in criminal prosecution, massive fines, and debarment. CMMC noncompliance means losing access to DoD contracts that may represent the majority of your revenue.

## What Is CMMC?

The Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification is the Department of Defense's unified standard for measuring and verifying cybersecurity practices across the defense industrial base. CMMC 2.0 replaced the original five level model with a streamlined three level framework that aligns directly with existing standards, primarily NIST SP 800 171.

Before CMMC, defense contractors were required to self attest their compliance with DFARS cybersecurity requirements. The problem was widespread: contractors claimed compliance on paper while their actual security posture fell far short. Studies found that the vast majority of defense contractors failed to implement even basic cybersecurity controls. CMMC addresses this by requiring independent verification for organizations handling the most sensitive information.

CMMC is not a new set of security requirements. It is a verification mechanism that ensures contractors actually implement the controls they have been required to implement since 2017 under DFARS clause 252.204 7012.

## The Three CMMC Levels Explained

### CMMC Level 1: Foundational

**17 Practices | Self Assessment | Annual Affirmation**

Level 1 applies to contractors who handle Federal Contract Information (FCI) but do not process, store, or transmit Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). FCI is information provided by or generated for the government under contract that is not intended for public release.

Level 1 requires implementation of 17 basic cybersecurity practices drawn from FAR clause 52.204 21. These are fundamental security hygiene practices that every business should already have in place, including access controls, identification and authentication, media protection, physical protection, system and communications protection, and system and information integrity.

Level 1 certification is achieved through annual self assessment. There is no third party audit requirement.

**Who needs Level 1:** Contractors whose DoD work involves only FCI, such as vendors providing commercial products or basic services without access to sensitive technical data.

### CMMC Level 2: Advanced

**110 Practices | Third Party Assessment (C3PAO) | Triennial with Annual Affirmation**

Level 2 applies to contractors who handle Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). This is the level that most defense contractors will need to achieve, and it is the level that requires the most significant investment in cybersecurity controls, documentation, and assessment preparation.

Level 2 maps directly to the 110 security controls in NIST SP 800 171 Revision 2. These controls span 14 families: Access Control, Awareness and Training, Audit and Accountability, Configuration Management, Identification and Authentication, Incident Response, Maintenance, Media Protection, Personnel Security, Physical Protection, Risk Assessment, Security Assessment, System and Communications Protection, and System and Information Integrity.

For most contractors, Level 2 requires assessment by a CMMC Third Party Assessor Organization (C3PAO). A subset of Level 2 programs may allow self assessment, but the majority of CUI handling contracts will require the third party route.

**Who needs Level 2:** Any contractor that processes, stores, or transmits CUI. This includes manufacturers with technical drawings, construction firms with facility plans, IT providers with system configurations, engineering firms with design data, and professional services firms with sensitive program information.

### CMMC Level 3: Expert

**110+ Practices | Government Led Assessment | Triennial**

Level 3 applies to contractors supporting the most critical DoD programs where Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are a significant concern. Level 3 builds on Level 2 by adding controls from NIST SP 800 172, which addresses enhanced security requirements for protecting CUI in critical programs.

Level 3 assessments are conducted by the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) Defense Industrial Base Cybersecurity Assessment Center (DIBCAC), not by C3PAOs.

**Who needs Level 3:** A relatively small number of contractors working on the most sensitive defense programs. If you need Level 3, your contracting officer or program office will make that clear.

---

## Who Needs CMMC?

CMMC applies to every organization in the defense supply chain that handles FCI or CUI. This includes:

**Defense Manufacturers:** Machine shops, fabricators, electronics manufacturers, and assembly operations that produce components or finished products for DoD programs. These organizations almost always handle CUI in the form of technical drawings, specifications, and test data.

**Construction Contractors:** General contractors and specialty subcontractors working on military installations, government facilities, and DoD infrastructure. CUI in construction includes facility plans, security specifications, and infrastructure details.

**IT and Managed Service Providers:** Companies providing IT services to defense contractors. If you have access to your clients' CUI environments, you need CMMC certification at the appropriate level.

**Engineering and Professional Services:** Firms providing design, engineering, consulting, or other professional services that involve access to CUI.

**Healthcare and Dental Practices:** Providers serving military personnel and their families through TRICARE and other DoD health programs may handle CUI related to medical readiness data.

**Accounting and CPA Firms:** Firms handling financial data for defense contractors may encounter CUI in cost and pricing information.

**Any Organization in the Supply Chain:** If you are a subcontractor, supplier, or service provider to a defense contractor and you handle FCI or CUI, CMMC applies to you.

## What Is CUI?

Controlled Unclassified Information is government created or government owned information that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls consistent with applicable laws, regulations, and government policies. CUI is not classified information, but it is sensitive enough to require protection beyond what basic public information receives.

In the defense contracting context, common categories of CUI include:

- Technical drawings and engineering data
- Manufacturing process specifications
- Test and evaluation data
- Export controlled information
- Critical infrastructure information
- Physical security information
- Procurement and acquisition data
- Budget and financial data related to defense programs
- Personally identifiable information (PII) of military personnel
- Medical readiness data

The CUI Registry maintained by the National Archives provides the definitive list of CUI categories and subcategories. Identifying what qualifies as CUI in your specific contracts is a critical first step in CMMC compliance.

## DFARS Clauses You Need to Know

### DFARS 252.204 7012: Safeguarding Covered Defense Information

This is the foundational DFARS clause that requires defense contractors to implement NIST SP 800 171 controls, report cyber incidents within 72 hours, and flow down requirements to subcontractors. This clause has been in effect since 2017 and is the basis for current CMMC requirements.

### DFARS 252.204 7019: Notice of NIST SP 800 171 Assessment Requirements

This clause requires contractors to have a current NIST SP 800 171 self assessment on record in SPRS and to ensure their self assessment is not more than three years old.

### DFARS 252.204 7020: NIST SP 800 171 DoD Assessment Requirements

This clause gives the DoD the right to conduct higher level assessments of your NIST SP 800 171 implementation, including Medium and High confidence assessments conducted by DIBCAC.

## SPRS Scoring Explained

The Supplier Performance Risk System (SPRS) is the DoD's platform for tracking contractor cybersecurity self assessments. Every defense contractor handling CUI must submit a self assessment score based on their implementation of NIST SP 800 171 controls.

### How Scoring Works

Your SPRS score starts at 110 (perfect implementation of all controls) and decreases based on unimplemented controls. Each of the 110 controls has an assigned point value of 1, 3, or 5 points. Controls that are not implemented reduce your score by their assigned value.

The minimum possible score is negative 203 (no controls implemented). A score of 110 means all controls are fully implemented.

### What Your Score Means

Contracting officers can view your SPRS score before making contract award decisions. A low score may not automatically disqualify you, but a significantly negative score raises serious questions about your security posture. More importantly, an inaccurate score creates legal exposure under the False Claims Act. If you claim a score of 85 but your actual implementation supports a score of 30, you have made a false representation to the federal government.

### The Reality

Studies and assessments have consistently shown that most defense contractors, especially small and mid size manufacturers, score far lower than they reported in SPRS. Many contractors submitted scores based on partial implementation, planned controls, or optimistic self evaluation. CMMC's third party assessment requirement exists specifically to address this gap between self reported scores and reality.

## The CMMC Certification Timeline

### Phase 1 (Late 2025)

CMMC requirements begin appearing in new DoD solicitations. Level 1 self assessments and a subset of Level 2 self assessments are the initial focus.

### Phase 2 (2026)

Third party C3PAO assessments for Level 2 become required in an increasing number of contracts. The ecosystem of authorized assessors continues to grow.

### Phase 3 (2027)

CMMC requirements become standard across DoD solicitations. Level 3 assessments begin for applicable programs.

### Full Implementation (2028)

CMMC is fully integrated into all applicable DoD contracts. All contractors in the defense supply chain must hold appropriate certification.

The key takeaway: if you need Level 2 certification and have not started preparing, you are behind. Most organizations need 12 to 18 months to achieve Level 2 readiness. Starting now positions you to have certification in hand before the majority of contracts require it.

## The C3PAO Assessment Process

For Level 2 certification, your organization will be assessed by an authorized C3PAO. Here is what to expect:

**Pre Assessment:** You select a C3PAO from the Cyber AB marketplace. The C3PAO reviews your System Security Plan and supporting documentation before conducting the on site assessment.

**Assessment:** The C3PAO assessment team evaluates your implementation of all 110 NIST SP 800 171 controls through documentation review, interviews with key personnel, and technical testing. Assessments typically take 3 to 5 days on site depending on the size and complexity of your environment.

**Findings:** The assessment team documents their findings for each control as MET, NOT MET, or NOT APPLICABLE. Controls that are NOT MET may be addressed through a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) under certain conditions, but there are limits on which controls can be deferred.

**Certification Decision:** Based on the assessment findings, a certification decision is made. If you pass, your CMMC Level 2 certification is valid for three years with annual affirmation requirements.

## Capital Cyber's Approach to CMMC

### Step 1: Scoping and Discovery

We identify what data you handle (FCI, CUI, or both), map how it flows through your organization, and define your CMMC assessment boundary. Accurate scoping is the single most impactful decision in your compliance program. Over scoping wastes money. Under scoping fails assessments.

### Step 2: Gap Assessment

We evaluate your current security posture against the applicable CMMC level requirements and produce a detailed gap analysis with prioritized remediation recommendations.

### Step 3: Remediation Planning

We create a realistic Plan of Action and Milestones that sequences remediation activities by priority, effort, and dependency. This becomes your roadmap from current state to assessment readiness.

### Step 4: Implementation

We implement the technical controls, deploy security tools, create policies and procedures, and build the documentation package required for assessment. As a full service cybersecurity and IT firm, we handle everything from firewall configuration to employee training.

### Step 5: Assessment Preparation

We conduct mock assessments, review evidence packages, prepare key personnel for interviews, and ensure you are fully ready before engaging your C3PAO.

### Step 6: Ongoing Compliance

CMMC is not a one time certification. It requires continuous implementation and annual affirmation. Capital Cyber provides ongoing managed security services that keep your compliance current between triennial assessments.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does CMMC compliance cost?

Costs vary significantly based on your current security posture, the amount of CUI you handle, and your target CMMC level. Level 1 typically costs $5,000 to $15,000. Level 2 ranges from $50,000 to $150,000 or more depending on the size and complexity of your environment. Level 3 can exceed $200,000. Capital Cyber provides detailed cost estimates after our initial scoping assessment.

### How long does it take to get CMMC certified?

Level 1 can often be achieved in 1 to 3 months. Level 2 typically requires 12 to 18 months of preparation before you are ready for a C3PAO assessment. The assessment itself takes 3 to 5 days, and the certification decision follows shortly after.

### Do I need CMMC if I am only a subcontractor?

Yes. If you handle FCI or CUI as a subcontractor, CMMC requirements flow down to you. Your prime contractor is required to include CMMC requirements in your subcontract if you will access FCI or CUI.

### Can I achieve CMMC with my current IT provider?

Possibly, but be cautious. CMMC requires deep cybersecurity expertise, not just general IT knowledge. Many IT providers lack the specialized skills needed for CMMC compliance. Capital Cyber is a cybersecurity firm that provides IT, not the other way around. This distinction matters when your certification is on the line.

### What is the difference between CMMC and NIST SP 800 171?

NIST SP 800 171 defines the 110 security controls that protect CUI. CMMC is the verification framework that confirms you have actually implemented those controls. Think of NIST SP 800 171 as the exam content and CMMC as the proctored test.

### Do I need to hire a CISO?

Not necessarily. A full time CISO typically costs $150,000 to $250,000 or more annually. Capital Cyber's CISO in a Box service provides the same strategic security leadership at a fraction of the cost, scaled to your organization's size and needs.

### What if we fail the C3PAO assessment?

If your assessment identifies unmet controls, you will have the opportunity to remediate and reassess. However, failed assessments cost time, money, and potentially contract opportunities. Capital Cyber's thorough preparation process is designed to ensure you pass the first time. Our mock assessments identify and address issues before the real assessment begins.

### Can Capital Cyber serve as our C3PAO?

No. CMMC rules prohibit the same organization from providing both consulting/preparation services and conducting the official assessment. Capital Cyber prepares you for assessment, and you select an independent C3PAO from the Cyber AB marketplace to conduct your official assessment.

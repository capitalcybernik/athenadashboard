## Why Construction Companies Need CMMC Now

### CMMC Phase 1 Is Live

As of late 2025, the Department of Defense has begun including CMMC requirements in new contract solicitations. This is not a future possibility. It is happening now. Construction companies that bid on DoD projects are already encountering CMMC requirements in RFPs, and the rollout will only accelerate through 2026 and beyond.

### Flow Down Requirements Hit Subcontractors

CMMC compliance is not just for general contractors. Under DFARS clause 252.204 7012, prime contractors must flow down cybersecurity requirements to every subcontractor that handles Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). In construction, CUI commonly includes building plans for secure facilities, physical security specifications, utility infrastructure details, communication system layouts, and construction schedules for sensitive installations.

If you are a mechanical, electrical, or specialty subcontractor working on DoD construction projects, your prime contractor will increasingly require you to demonstrate CMMC compliance before bringing you onto a project.

### Public Works and Military Construction Are High Priority

The DoD spends billions annually on military construction (MILCON), base operations support, and facility maintenance. These contracts frequently involve CUI related to force protection, facility security, and infrastructure vulnerabilities. Construction contractors working on installations, bases, and government facilities handle some of the most sensitive building information in the federal portfolio.

## Construction Specific Cybersecurity Challenges

### Project Based IT Creates Unique Risks

Unlike office based businesses with static IT environments, construction companies operate across multiple jobsites with temporary connectivity, shared devices, and transient workforces. Project trailers use consumer grade routers. Field superintendents access plans on personal tablets. Project managers email blueprints from hotel Wi Fi networks.

Every jobsite is a potential entry point for attackers, and every project creates a new, temporary IT environment that must be secured. Traditional cybersecurity approaches designed for fixed office networks simply do not work for construction.

### Subcontractor Sprawl Multiplies Risk

A typical DoD construction project involves dozens of subcontractors, each with their own IT systems, security practices (or lack thereof), and access to project data. When you share building information systems (BIM) models, specifications, and drawings with subcontractors, you are extending your CUI boundary to include their environments.

Managing cybersecurity across this sprawling network of subcontractors is one of the biggest CMMC challenges for construction companies. Capital Cyber helps you build a subcontractor management program that satisfies flow down requirements without creating an administrative nightmare.

### Legacy and Paper Based Processes

Many construction companies still rely on paper based workflows, legacy project management systems, and informal file sharing practices. While paper processes might seem "more secure" than digital ones, they actually create significant CMMC challenges: paper CUI requires physical security controls, tracking and accountability measures, and proper destruction procedures that most construction companies have never implemented.

The transition from paper to secure digital workflows is often a significant part of the CMMC compliance journey for construction firms.

### Multi Site Security Across Active Jobsites

Securing a single office is straightforward. Securing a main office, three project trailers, two satellite offices, and a dozen jobsites simultaneously requires a fundamentally different approach. Each location needs appropriate security controls, network protection, and access management, all coordinated through a central security program.

Capital Cyber designs multi site security architectures specifically for construction companies, using cloud based solutions, mobile device management, and secure remote access tools that move with your projects.

## Capital Cyber's CMMC Solution for Construction

### We Know Construction Is Different

Capital Cyber does not apply a one size fits all CMMC template to your construction business. We understand the project lifecycle, the role of subcontractors, the challenges of field operations, and the practical realities of an industry that builds things in the physical world while managing data in the digital one.

### Our Construction CMMC Process

**Phase 1: Discovery and Scoping (Weeks 1 through 4)**

We analyze your business operations to determine exactly where CUI enters and flows through your organization. For construction companies, this means examining how you receive project data from the government, how you share information with subcontractors, what systems process CUI (project management, BIM, email, file storage), and how field personnel access sensitive information.

**Phase 2: Gap Assessment (Weeks 4 through 6)**

We evaluate your current security controls against the applicable CMMC level requirements. For Level 1, this means 17 basic practices. For Level 2, this means all 110 controls in NIST SP 800 171. We produce a detailed gap analysis and Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) that prioritizes remediation by risk and effort.

**Phase 3: Remediation and Implementation (Weeks 6 through 30)**

This is where the real work happens. We implement the technical controls, security tools, and policies needed to close your gaps. For construction companies, this typically includes deploying secure cloud platforms for CUI handling, implementing mobile device management across field devices, securing project trailers and temporary jobsite networks, establishing encrypted communication channels, creating access control systems for project data, deploying endpoint protection on all devices, and building incident response procedures that work across distributed jobsites.

**Phase 4: Documentation (Ongoing)**

CMMC requires extensive documentation including your System Security Plan (SSP), POA&M, incident response plan, and supporting policies. We create all documentation tailored to your construction operations, not generic templates.

**Phase 5: Assessment Preparation (Weeks 30 through 36)**

We prepare your team for the C3PAO assessment through mock assessments, evidence collection, and interview coaching. Construction companies often have personnel who have never been through a cybersecurity audit, so preparation is especially important.

## Frequently Asked Questions: CMMC for Construction

### Does CMMC really apply to construction companies?

Yes. Any company that contracts or subcontracts with the Department of Defense and handles Federal Contract Information (FCI) or Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) must achieve the appropriate CMMC level. Construction companies working on military installations, government facilities, and DoD infrastructure projects routinely handle CUI including building plans, security specifications, and infrastructure details.

### What CMMC level do most construction contractors need?

It depends on the data you handle. If your contracts only involve FCI (basic contract information), Level 1 is sufficient. If you handle CUI such as facility blueprints for secure buildings, force protection plans, or utility infrastructure details, you need Level 2. Most construction contractors working directly on DoD facilities will need Level 2.

### I am a subcontractor. Do I need CMMC certification?

If you receive CUI from a prime contractor on a DoD project, yes. The prime contractor is required to flow down CMMC requirements under DFARS 252.204 7012. Even if you are a specialty subcontractor handling only a portion of the project, if that portion involves CUI, you need appropriate CMMC certification.

### How do I secure multiple jobsites?

Capital Cyber designs multi site security architectures using cloud based platforms, VPN solutions, mobile device management, and standardized security configurations that can be deployed and removed as projects start and finish. We create a repeatable security framework that moves with your business.

### What about our field workers who use personal devices?

Personal device usage (BYOD) is one of the biggest challenges in construction cybersecurity. CMMC requires controls on any device that accesses CUI. Options include implementing mobile device management on personal devices, providing company owned devices for CUI access, or creating secure access portals that keep CUI off personal devices entirely. Capital Cyber helps you choose and implement the right approach for your workforce.

### How long does CMMC compliance take for a construction company?

Plan for 9 to 18 months depending on your starting point and target level. Level 1 can often be achieved in 3 to 6 months. Level 2 typically requires 12 to 18 months of preparation. Starting early gives you a competitive advantage as more DoD construction contracts include CMMC requirements.

### What happens if we do not get CMMC certified?

You will be unable to bid on or perform DoD contracts that include CMMC requirements. As CMMC rolls out across more solicitations through 2026 and beyond, non compliant contractors will lose access to a significant portion of the federal construction market. Prime contractors may also replace non compliant subcontractors with certified alternatives.

### Can you also handle our regular IT support?

Yes. Capital Cyber is a full service cybersecurity and IT firm. We manage your entire technology environment, from help desk support to network management, with security integrated into every layer. Having one provider for both IT and CMMC compliance eliminates the gaps and conflicts that arise when multiple vendors are involved.

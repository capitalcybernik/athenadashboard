## The Problem: Manufacturing and Cybersecurity Have Been Worlds Apart

For decades, manufacturers focused on what they do best: building things. Cybersecurity was an afterthought, something the "IT guy" handled between fixing printers and resetting passwords. But the defense industrial base faces a threat landscape that has fundamentally changed, and the Department of Defense is no longer willing to trust self attestation alone.

### Here Is What We See on Nearly Every Manufacturing Shop Floor

**Legacy CNC and Industrial Control Systems Running Outdated Software**

Your CNC machines, PLCs, and industrial control systems are the backbone of production. Many run on Windows XP, Windows 7, or proprietary operating systems that haven't seen a security patch in years. These systems often sit on the same network as your email, your ERP system, and your engineering files. A single vulnerability in a legacy CNC controller can give an attacker a direct path to your most sensitive defense data.

CMMC compliance for manufacturing operations requires you to address these legacy systems without shutting down production. That is a challenge most general IT providers simply do not understand.

**CUI Scattered Across the Shop Floor**

Controlled Unclassified Information does not stay neatly inside a file server. In manufacturing environments, CUI shows up in unexpected places: printed drawings taped to workstations, USB drives passed between machine operators, CAD files emailed to subcontractors, and technical data packages stored on personal laptops.

Identifying where CUI lives, how it flows, and who touches it is the critical first step in any CMMC compliance program for manufacturers. Without accurate CUI scoping, you will either over scope your environment (spending far more than necessary) or under scope it (failing your assessment).

**ERP Systems That Touch Everything**

Your Enterprise Resource Planning system is likely the single most connected application in your business. It touches procurement, production scheduling, inventory, shipping, and often contains technical specifications, contract details, and pricing data that qualifies as CUI. Properly scoping your ERP system for CMMC is one of the most complex and consequential decisions in your compliance journey.

**CAD/CAM Files and Engineering Data in Unsecured Locations**

Engineering drawings, 3D models, toolpath programs, and manufacturing process sheets often contain the most sensitive CUI in your organization. These files frequently live on shared drives with minimal access controls, get transferred via unencrypted email, and are backed up to systems that fall outside your security boundary.

Creating secure enclaves for CAD/CAM data is a proven strategy that limits your CMMC scope while keeping engineers productive. Capital Cyber specializes in designing these enclaves so your team can work efficiently within a compliant environment.

**ITAR Overlap Creating Compounding Requirements**

If you manufacture defense articles or provide defense services, you likely have International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) obligations on top of CMMC requirements. These two frameworks overlap significantly but are not identical. ITAR violations carry criminal penalties including fines up to $1 million per violation and up to 20 years imprisonment. CMMC adds another layer of technical controls that ITAR alone does not address.

Many manufacturers discover too late that their ITAR compliance program does not satisfy CMMC requirements, creating gaps that jeopardize both their export licenses and their DoD contracts.

**Subcontractor Flow Down Requirements**

DFARS clause 252.204 7012 requires you to flow down cybersecurity requirements to every subcontractor that handles CUI. If your machine shop sends technical data packages to a heat treating facility, a plating shop, or a testing lab, those subcontractors must also meet CMMC requirements. Managing this flow down is your responsibility as the prime or upper tier contractor.

Most manufacturers we work with have between 5 and 50 subcontractors who handle CUI. Ensuring every one of them meets compliance requirements is a logistical challenge that Capital Cyber helps you manage systematically.

**SPRS Scores That Don't Reflect Reality**

The Supplier Performance Risk System (SPRS) requires every defense contractor to submit a self assessed score based on NIST SP 800 171. Scores range from negative 203 to positive 110. The Department of Defense can view your score at any time, and contracting officers increasingly check SPRS scores before awarding contracts.

Here is the uncomfortable truth: most manufacturers submitted SPRS scores that are significantly higher than their actual security posture. When the DoD audits your self assessment (and they are auditing), a score that does not match reality creates serious legal exposure under the False Claims Act.

## The Solution: CMMC Compliance Built for Manufacturing

Capital Cyber is not a general IT company that added "CMMC" to its service list. We are a cybersecurity firm that provides managed IT services, and that distinction matters enormously for defense manufacturers.

### Our Approach to CMMC Compliance for Manufacturers

**Step 1: CUI Scoping and Data Flow Analysis**

We start by mapping exactly where CUI enters, moves through, and exits your organization. This includes digital systems, physical processes, and subcontractor relationships. Accurate scoping is the foundation of everything that follows. Over scoping wastes money. Under scoping fails audits.

**Step 2: Gap Assessment Against NIST SP 800 171**

We evaluate your current security posture against all 110 controls in NIST SP 800 171, which forms the basis of CMMC Level 2. Our assessment identifies every gap, prioritizes them by risk and remediation effort, and produces a realistic Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M).

**Step 3: Legacy System Strategy**

We design solutions for your legacy CNC machines, ICS systems, and other equipment that cannot be patched or upgraded. This typically involves network segmentation, monitoring, compensating controls, and in some cases, creating isolated operational technology (OT) networks that fall outside your CUI boundary.

**Step 4: Enclave Architecture**

Rather than securing your entire network to CMMC Level 2 standards (which is expensive and disruptive), we design secure enclaves that contain CUI processing to a defined, manageable boundary. This approach dramatically reduces both cost and complexity while maintaining full compliance.

**Step 5: Policy and Documentation**

CMMC requires extensive documentation including a System Security Plan (SSP), POA&M, incident response plan, configuration management procedures, and more. We create all required documentation tailored to your specific manufacturing environment, not generic templates that assessors see through immediately.

**Step 6: Implementation and Remediation**

We implement the technical controls, deploy the security tools, configure the systems, and close the gaps identified in your assessment. For manufacturing clients, this includes securing shop floor systems, implementing multi factor authentication, deploying endpoint detection and response, configuring encrypted communications, and establishing backup and recovery procedures.

**Step 7: Assessment Preparation and Support**

When you are ready for your C3PAO assessment, we prepare your team through mock assessments, evidence collection, and interview preparation. We have guided manufacturers through successful assessments and understand exactly what assessors look for.

## Frequently Asked Questions: CMMC for Manufacturers

### What is CMMC and why does it affect my manufacturing business?

The Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC 2.0) is the Department of Defense's framework for verifying that defense contractors actually implement the cybersecurity controls they claim to have. If your manufacturing company holds DoD contracts or subcontracts that involve Federal Contract Information (FCI) or Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), you must achieve the appropriate CMMC level to continue winning and performing on those contracts.

### When does CMMC become mandatory for manufacturers?

CMMC Phase 1 went live in late 2025, and the DoD is progressively including CMMC requirements in new contracts. By 2026, an increasing number of solicitations require CMMC certification. If you have not started your compliance journey, you are already behind the timeline most C3PAOs recommend, which is 12 to 18 months of preparation for Level 2.

### What CMMC level does my manufacturing company need?

If you only handle Federal Contract Information (FCI), you need Level 1 (17 practices, self assessment). If you handle Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), which includes technical drawings, specifications, test data, and many other data types common in manufacturing, you need Level 2 (110 practices, third party assessment). Level 3 is reserved for contractors handling the most sensitive programs and requires a government led assessment.

### How do I handle legacy CNC machines that cannot be updated?

Legacy equipment that cannot receive security patches must be addressed through compensating controls. Common approaches include network isolation (placing legacy machines on segmented networks with no CUI access), monitoring (deploying sensors that detect anomalous traffic), and boundary protection (ensuring legacy systems cannot reach CUI repositories). Capital Cyber designs these solutions specifically for manufacturing environments.

### What about my ERP system? Does the entire system need to be in scope?

Not necessarily. ERP scoping is one of the most important decisions in your CMMC program. If your ERP system processes, stores, or transmits CUI, those modules and the underlying infrastructure are in scope. However, through careful architecture and data flow analysis, it is often possible to limit CUI processing to specific modules, reducing your overall compliance boundary.

### How do I manage subcontractor flow down requirements?

Under DFARS 252.204 7012, you must flow down cybersecurity requirements to subcontractors who handle CUI. This means verifying that your subcontractors have appropriate CMMC certification, including flow down clauses in your subcontracts, monitoring subcontractor compliance, and maintaining documentation of your flow down program. Capital Cyber helps you build a systematic approach to subcontractor management.

### What is an SPRS score and do I need one?

Yes. Every defense contractor must submit a self assessment score to the Supplier Performance Risk System based on their implementation of NIST SP 800 171 controls. Your score ranges from negative 203 to positive 110. Contracting officers can check your score before awarding contracts, and the DoD is actively auditing self assessments. An inaccurate SPRS score creates legal exposure under the False Claims Act.

### How long does CMMC compliance take for a typical manufacturer?

Most manufacturing companies need 12 to 18 months to achieve CMMC Level 2 readiness, depending on their starting point. Companies with minimal existing security controls may need longer. The process includes scoping (1 to 2 months), gap assessment (1 month), remediation planning (1 month), implementation (6 to 12 months), documentation (ongoing), and assessment preparation (1 to 2 months).

### What happens if I am not CMMC compliant?

Without the required CMMC certification, you will be ineligible to bid on or perform DoD contracts that include CMMC requirements. This means losing existing contracts as they come up for renewal and being unable to compete for new ones. For many defense manufacturers, this represents 30% to 80% of their revenue.

### Can Capital Cyber also manage our day to day IT?

Absolutely. In fact, this is one of our key differentiators. As a cybersecurity firm that provides IT services, we manage your entire IT environment with security built into every layer. This means your daily IT operations, help desk support, network management, and system administration are all handled by the same team that designed your CMMC compliance program. No gaps, no handoffs, no conflicting priorities.

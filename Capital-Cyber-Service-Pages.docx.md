## SECTION: FAQ

**Layout:** Accordion/dropdown format
**Background:** Light gray or white

**Section Title (H2):**
```
Common CMMC Questions
```

**Structured Data:** Include FAQ schema markup for SEO

### Q1:
**Q:** How long does CMMC compliance take?
**A:** CMMC Level 1 typically takes 4-6 weeks. CMMC Level 2 requires 12-16 weeks for most small-to-medium businesses. The timeline depends on your current security posture and the complexity of your IT environment.

### Q2:
**Q:** Do I need GCC High for CMMC Level 2?
**A:** Not necessarily. Many small and medium contractors can achieve Level 2 compliance with properly configured commercial Microsoft 365 and Azure environments. GCC High is typically only required for large enterprises or those handling ITAR data. We assess your specific needs and recommend the most cost-effective approach.

### Q3:
**Q:** What's the difference between NIST 800-171 and CMMC?
**A:** NIST 800-171 is the security standard. CMMC is the certification program that verifies you've implemented those standards. Think of NIST as the requirements and CMMC as the test you pass to prove compliance.

### Q4:
**Q:** Can I do a self-assessment for CMMC Level 2?
**A:** No. CMMC Level 2 requires assessment by an authorized C3PAO (Certified Third-Party Assessment Organization). Only Level 1 allows self-assessment. We prepare you for your C3PAO assessment and can connect you with trusted assessment partners.

### Q5:
**Q:** What happens if I fail my CMMC assessment?
**A:** You receive a list of deficiencies and have time to remediate them. About 40% of first-time assessments identify findings. Our clients typically pass on the first attempt because we conduct thorough readiness assessments before scheduling official C3PAO evaluations.

### Q6:
**Q:** How much does a C3PAO assessment cost?
**A:** C3PAO assessments typically cost $15,000 - $50,000 depending on organization size and complexity. This is separate from implementation costs. The DoD estimates total assessment and affirmation costs around $104,670 for Level 2, though small businesses often pay less.

### Q7:
**Q:** What's an SPRS score and why does it matter?
**A:** The Supplier Performance Risk System (SPRS) score reflects your NIST 800-171 compliance level. DoD contracts now require minimum scores. We help you calculate, optimize, and maintain your SPRS score.

### Q8:
**Q:** Do subcontractors need CMMC certification?
**A:** Yes. If your company handles FCI or CUI as a subcontractor, you need the same CMMC level as the prime contractor. This requirement flows down the entire supply chain.

## SECTION: WHAT IS A GAP ASSESSMENT

**H2:** What Is a NIST 800-171 Gap Assessment?

A NIST 800-171 gap assessment is a comprehensive evaluation of your organization's current cybersecurity practices against the 110 security requirements defined in NIST Special Publication 800-171.

**The assessment answers three critical questions:**

1. **Where are we now?** What controls are already implemented?
2. **Where do we need to be?** What gaps exist against NIST requirements?
3. **How do we get there?** What is the prioritized remediation roadmap?

**Why It Matters:**
- Required for accurate SPRS scoring
- Foundation for CMMC certification
- Identifies security risks before attackers do
- Creates defensible compliance documentation
- Prioritizes investments for maximum impact

## SECTION: FAQ

**H2:** Gap Assessment FAQs

### Q1:
**Q:** How long does a gap assessment take?
**A:** Standard assessments take 2 weeks from kickoff to final report. Comprehensive assessments take 3 weeks. The actual time commitment from your team is typically 4-6 hours of interviews and evidence gathering.

### Q2:
**Q:** What's the difference between a gap assessment and a readiness assessment?
**A:** A gap assessment identifies where you are vs. where you need to be. A readiness assessment is the final check before your C3PAO assessment to ensure you're actually ready. We recommend a gap assessment early in your journey and a readiness assessment 2-4 weeks before your official CMMC assessment.

### Q3:
**Q:** Do I need to prepare anything before the assessment?
**A:** We'll provide a preparation checklist, but generally you should have:
- Network diagrams (even rough ones)
- List of systems and software used
- Current policies (if any exist)
- Key personnel available for interviews
- Access to IT systems for our assessors

### Q4:
**Q:** Will you fix the gaps you find?
**A:** The gap assessment is diagnostic only. However, we offer implementation services to remediate the gaps we identify. Many clients engage us for both the assessment and remediation because we already understand their environment.

### Q5:
**Q:** How accurate is your SPRS score calculation?
**A:** We calculate your SPRS score based on the same methodology used by the DoD. Our assessments typically predict SPRS scores within 5-10 points of official scores. We also identify quick wins to improve your score before submission.

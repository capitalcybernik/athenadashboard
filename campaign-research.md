## Part 1: FBI Operation Winter SHIELD

### Overview

**Operation Winter SHIELD** (Securing Homeland Infrastructure by Enhancing Layered Defense) is a nationwide cyber resilience campaign launched by the FBI on **January 28, 2026**. It was announced in conjunction with the National Cyber Strategy and the FBI Cyber Strategy, and is designed to help organizations—across both public and private sectors—improve their resilience against cyber intrusions.

The campaign identifies the **10 most impactful actions** organizations can take right now to defend against cyberattacks. Brett Leatherman, Assistant Director of the FBI's Cyber Division, stated these controls are meant not "to check boxes" but to "start the conversation" and help build security controls across the private sector.

### Why It Matters for Tax Professionals & CPAs

While Operation Winter SHIELD targets **all organizations** (not just tax professionals specifically), its recommendations are directly relevant to CPA firms and tax preparers because:

- CPA firms are classified as **"financial institutions"** under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and FTC Safeguards Rule
- Tax professionals handle highly sensitive data (SSNs, financial records, bank accounts) making them prime targets
- The FBI developed the recommendations by drawing on **recent investigations reflecting real-world adversary behavior and common defensive gaps** seen across sectors
- The campaign specifically targets both **IT and OT environments**, covering the digital infrastructure that accounting firms rely on

### The 10 Actions to Improve Cyber Resilience

Each week of the 10-week campaign, the FBI focuses on one key defense and connects it to real FBI cases:

1. **Adopt phish-resistant authentication** — Transition from legacy authentication (including SMS-based MFA) to FIDO2-compliant security keys or device-bound passkeys. Administrators and executives should be prioritized for deployment.

2. **Implement a risk-based vulnerability management program** — Maintain a complete asset inventory, perform authenticated internal scans, and set remediation timelines proportional to system criticality.

3. **Track and retire end-of-life (EOL) technology on a defined schedule** — Maintain a rolling EOL forecast and ensure timely replacement or isolation of unsupported assets.

4. **Manage third-party risk** — Maintain a centralized register of vendors with network or data access, enforce least-privilege access, and mandate breach-notification obligations contractually.

5. **Protect security logs and preserve for an appropriate time** — Consolidate logs into secure, immutable storage with retention aligned to legal/incident-response needs (commonly ≥12 months).

6. **Maintain offline, immutable backups and test restoration** — Adversaries frequently target backups early in attacks; retain offline, immutable copies and perform routine restoration testing.

7. **Identify, inventory, and protect internet-facing systems and services** — Maintain an accurate inventory of externally exposed assets and apply timely patches.

8. **Strengthen email authentication and malicious content protections** — Implement enhanced email authentication and robust content filtering to mitigate phishing.

9. **Reduce administrator privileges** — Minimize privileged accounts; elevated access should be used only where operationally necessary.

10. **Exercise your incident response plan with all stakeholders** — Conduct periodic incident response exercises to ensure operational readiness.

### Key Context & Statistics

- The campaign launched on **January 28, 2026**, tied to the National Cyber Strategy
- U.S. businesses have faced a **surge in cyber incidents** including ransomware, supply-chain compromises, fraud, and state-sponsored intrusions
- Q1 2025 recorded the **highest number of ransomware victims on record** ([Blackfog](https://www.blackfog.com/the-state-of-ransomware-2025/))
- **Small and medium businesses represent 43% of all cyberattack targets** ([Astra](https://www.getastra.com/blog/security-audit/small-business-cyber-attack-statistics/))
- **90% of breaches** still occur from human error
- Many successful attacks exploited **known vulnerabilities, particularly in outdated systems, legacy hardware, and unpatched software**

#### 3. Ascension Data & Analytics — FTC Safeguards Rule Enforcement

**Date:** December 2020

**What happened:** The FTC brought an enforcement action against Ascension Data & Analytics, a Texas-based mortgage industry data analytics company, for **violating the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act's Safeguards Rule**. While this is a financial services (not specifically CPA) case, it is highly relevant as a Safeguards Rule enforcement precedent.

- Ascension hired a vendor (OpticsML) to perform text recognition scanning on mortgage documents
- The vendor stored contents of documents on a **cloud-based server in plain text**, without passwords or encryption
- Documents contained SSNs, dates of birth, loan information, credit/debit account numbers, driver's license numbers, and credit files
- The unprotected cloud server was **accessed dozens of times** by unauthorized parties
- Ascension **failed to vet the vendor**, contracts didn't require safeguards, and no risk assessments were conducted

**Penalty:**
- Required to implement a **comprehensive data security program**
- **Biennial independent security assessments**
- Senior executive annual compliance certification
- Must report future breaches to the FTC within 10 days
- Each future violation of the consent order: up to **$43,280 per violation**

### B. FTC Safeguards Rule — Penalty Framework for CPA Firms

The FTC Safeguards Rule (16 CFR Part 314), updated in 2021 and 2023, applies directly to **CPA firms, tax preparers, and financial advisors** because they qualify as "financial institutions" under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.

#### Who Must Comply

The Rule explicitly covers **13 types of financial institutions** including:
- **Tax preparation firms** (explicitly named)
- Accountants and CPA firms
- Financial advisors not registered with the SEC
- Credit counselors and financial planners
- Mortgage lenders and brokers
- Collection agencies
- Any business that handles consumer financial data

**There is no minimum size threshold** — solo practitioners face the same fundamental requirements as large firms (with limited exemptions for firms with fewer than 5,000 consumer records).

#### Penalty Structure

| Violation Type | Maximum Penalty |
|---|---|
| Civil penalties per violation | **Up to $100,000** |
| Consent order violations | **Up to $43,000 per day** (some sources cite $46,000 per day) |
| Personal fines against officers/directors | **Up to $10,000 per violation** |
| Criminal penalties (willful violations) | **Up to 5 years imprisonment** |
| Corrective actions | Mandatory security program implementation |
| Ongoing monitoring | FTC oversight of compliance |

#### Breach Notification Requirements (Effective May 13, 2024)

CPA firms must now:
- **Notify the FTC within 30 days** after discovering a breach affecting 500+ consumers' unencrypted information
- Submit notifications through the FTC's online form
- This is **in addition to** state breach notification requirements (which vary by state)

> Source: [FTC Blog](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2024/05/safeguards-rule-notification-requirement-now-effect)

#### Nine Required Elements of Compliance

1. **Designate a Qualified Individual** to oversee the security program
2. **Conduct a written risk assessment** identifying foreseeable threats
3. **Implement access controls** with multi-factor authentication (can stop up to 99.9% of account compromise attempts)
4. **Design and implement safeguards** including encryption at rest and in transit
5. **Monitor and test** safeguards regularly (continuous monitoring or annual pen testing + semi-annual vulnerability scans)
6. **Train all staff** on security awareness
7. **Monitor service providers** who access customer data
8. **Keep the security program current** with regular updates
9. **Create a written incident response plan**

## Summary: Key Talking Points

### For the Campaign

1. **The FBI has spoken:** Operation Winter SHIELD (Jan 2026) identifies 10 critical cybersecurity actions every organization should take NOW — including CPA firms handling sensitive financial data.

2. **CPA firms are legally required to comply:** The FTC Safeguards Rule classifies ALL tax preparers and CPA firms as "financial institutions" — no size exemption. Non-compliance means fines up to $100,000 per violation, $10,000 personal liability for firm leaders, and even prison time.

3. **Real firms are getting hit:** Wojeski & Company, a CPA firm, paid $60,000 in penalties after a ransomware attack exposed 4,700+ clients' SSNs, financial data, and medical information. They took 1.5 years to notify victims.

4. **Even the biggest aren't immune:** Deloitte faced a $6.3M settlement after a cyberattack exposed 640,000 Rhode Islanders' personal data.

5. **The FTC is watching:** As of May 2024, firms MUST report breaches to the FTC within 30 days. The enforcement landscape has fundamentally changed.

6. **The cost of inaction:** $4.24M average breach cost. 43% of attacks target SMBs. 90% of breaches come from human error. A single breach can destroy client trust and a firm's reputation permanently.

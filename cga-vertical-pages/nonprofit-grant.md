# Cybersecurity Grants for Nonprofit Organizations

Nonprofits are under attack. Organizations that serve vulnerable populations, manage donor databases, and operate on tight budgets are prime targets for ransomware and data theft.

You hold sensitive information: donor PII, client health records, financial data, and operational details. A breach doesn't just expose data, it destroys donor trust and jeopardizes your mission.

**The Cyber Grants Alliance provides free cybersecurity grants to nonprofit organizations.** Get professional security assessments, staff training, and compliance support without diverting funds from your programs.

## Why Nonprofits Are Targeted

**Valuable Data, Limited Security**
Nonprofits collect extensive personal information from donors, clients, and staff. This data is valuable to attackers, yet most nonprofits lack dedicated IT security staff or enterprise-grade protection.

**Ransomware Impact**
A ransomware attack can shut down operations for weeks. For a nonprofit serving vulnerable populations, operational downtime means people don't get the services they need. Attackers know nonprofits are more likely to pay ransoms to restore mission-critical operations.

**Supply Chain Risk**
Many nonprofits rely on cloud-based donor management systems, grant platforms, and collaboration tools. Third-party breaches expose your organization to risk you don't control.

**Regulatory Requirements**
If you handle health information (HIPAA), payment card data (PCI-DSS), or serve as a government contractor, you're subject to cybersecurity regulations. Noncompliance can result in penalties and loss of funding.

**Donor Confidence**
Major donors and grantmakers are increasingly asking about cybersecurity. A breach can damage your reputation and reduce future funding. Demonstrable cybersecurity commitment protects donor relationships.

## Nonprofit-Specific Challenges We Address

**Limited IT Resources**
Most nonprofits have small or volunteer IT support. We provide practical, actionable recommendations that can be implemented with limited technical expertise or outsourced affordably.

**Distributed Teams**
Many nonprofits have remote staff, volunteers, and multiple locations. We help you secure data and communications across distributed environments without expensive infrastructure.

**Grant Compliance**
Federal and major foundation grants increasingly require cybersecurity attestations. We help you build the security program and documentation needed to qualify for funding.

**Donor Database Protection**
Your donor database is your organization's lifeblood. We assess CRM and donor management system security and implement controls to protect this critical asset.

**Board and Leadership Education**
Cybersecurity is a fiduciary responsibility. We provide board-appropriate security briefings and help leadership understand organizational risk.

**Volunteer Access Management**
Volunteers need access to systems but present unique security challenges. We help you implement secure volunteer onboarding and access controls.

## The Cost of Inaction

**Ransomware Recovery**
The average ransomware recovery cost for small organizations exceeds $100,000 in downtime, recovery, and reputation damage. Most nonprofits cannot absorb this.

**Donor Data Breach**
State breach notification laws require disclosure when donor PII is compromised. Lost donor confidence can reduce annual giving by 20-40%.

**Grant Funding Risk**
Major foundations and federal grant programs are adding cybersecurity requirements. Organizations without documented security programs risk losing funding eligibility.

**Mission Disruption**
Operational downtime from a cyberattack means services don't get delivered. For organizations serving vulnerable populations, this has real human impact.

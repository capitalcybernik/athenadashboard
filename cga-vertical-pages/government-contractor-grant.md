# Cybersecurity Grants for Government Contractors

If you hold or pursue DoD contracts, CMMC compliance is not optional. It's a gatekeeper. No certification, no contract.

The Cyber Grants Alliance provides free cybersecurity grants to government contractors who need to achieve CMMC Level 1 or Level 2 certification. Get professional gap assessments, remediation support, and readiness validation without draining your contract margins.

## Why CMMC Matters for Your Business

**Contract Eligibility**
As of late 2025, DoD contracting officers can include CMMC requirements as a condition of contract award. Primes are already requiring CMMC certification from subcontractors. If you're not certified, you're not bidding.

**Existing Contracts at Risk**
Your current DoD contracts may require CMMC certification at renewal. Failing to certify means losing work you've held for years to competitors who got ahead of the curve.

**Supply Chain Requirements**
Even if you don't contract directly with DoD, your prime contractors are flowing down CMMC requirements. The certification requirement cascades through every tier of the defense supply chain.

**New Contract Opportunities**
CMMC certification opens doors to contracts that were previously inaccessible. Being certified early positions you to capture new work as the requirement expands across federal agencies.

## Government Contractor-Specific Challenges

**CUI Scoping**
Most contractors struggle to identify where Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) enters, lives, and exits their environment. Incorrect scoping leads to failed assessments and wasted money. We help you map your actual CUI flow and scope your CMMC program correctly.

**Legacy System Compliance**
Many government contractors operate legacy systems, custom software, or specialized equipment that cannot easily meet CMMC requirements. We help you implement compensating controls and network segmentation strategies that satisfy assessors without replacing critical systems.

**FCI vs. CUI**
Not all government contract information requires the same protection. We help you understand the difference between Federal Contract Information (FCI) and CUI, and scope your compliance program appropriately.

**Multi-Contract Complexity**
If you support multiple contracts with different CUI types, compliance becomes complex. We help you build a unified security program that satisfies all contract requirements without duplicating effort.

**Third-Party Risk**
Your subcontractors, cloud providers, and IT vendors all impact your CMMC compliance. We assess your supply chain and help you manage third-party security requirements.

## The Cost of Waiting

**Lost Contracts**
Every month you delay CMMC certification is a month you cannot bid on CMMC-required contracts. For a contractor with $2M in annual DoD revenue, a 6-month delay could mean $1M in lost opportunities.

**Failed Assessment Costs**
Failing a C3PAO assessment means paying for remediation and re-assessment. The average cost of a failed assessment and re-test exceeds $50,000.

**Prime Relationship Risk**
Primes are building approved supplier lists based on CMMC status. If you're not on the list, you're not in the supply chain.

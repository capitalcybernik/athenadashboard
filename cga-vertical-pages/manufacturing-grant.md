# Cybersecurity Grants for Manufacturing Companies

American manufacturing is under attack. Ransomware, intellectual property theft, and supply chain compromises are hitting manufacturers harder than ever. Yet most manufacturers operate on thin margins that don't allow for enterprise-grade cybersecurity spending.

**The Cyber Grants Alliance (CGA) exists to bridge this gap.**

We provide free cybersecurity grants to manufacturers so you can identify vulnerabilities, protect your operations, and meet the compliance requirements your customers now demand.

## Why Manufacturers Are Targeted

**Operational Technology (OT) Vulnerabilities**
Your CNC machines, PLCs, and SCADA systems were built for reliability, not security. Many run outdated operating systems that cannot be patched. Attackers know this and specifically target manufacturing environments where a compromised machine can shut down entire production lines.

**Intellectual Property at Risk**
Your CAD files, proprietary processes, and product designs are valuable. Foreign competitors and cybercriminals actively seek to steal manufacturing IP. One breach can destroy your competitive advantage.

**Supply Chain Pressure**
Primes like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and General Dynamics are flowing down cybersecurity requirements to every supplier. If you cannot demonstrate cybersecurity maturity, you lose contracts to competitors who can.

**Ransomware Impact**
Manufacturing downtime costs average $22,000 per hour. A ransomware attack that takes your plant offline for 48 hours can cost over $1 million in lost production alone. Most manufacturers cannot absorb this.

## Manufacturing-Specific Challenges We Address

**Legacy Equipment**
Your 15-year-old CNC machine cannot take antivirus software. We help you implement compensating controls: network segmentation, monitoring, and access controls that protect legacy equipment without bricking it.

**Production Network Security**
Most manufacturers have flat networks where shop floor, front office, and guest WiFi all connect. We help you segment production environments to contain breaches and meet compliance requirements.

**Supply Chain Compliance**
Your customers are asking for cybersecurity attestations. We help you build the documentation and controls needed to satisfy prime contractor requirements and win contracts.

**IT/OT Convergence**
As manufacturing becomes more digital, the boundary between IT and OT blurs. We assess your converged environment and implement security that protects both sides without disrupting production.

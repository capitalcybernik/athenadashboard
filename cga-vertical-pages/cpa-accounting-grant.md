# Cybersecurity Grants for CPA and Accounting Firms

Accounting firms are among the most attractive targets for cybercriminals. You hold the financial data of hundreds of businesses and thousands of individuals. One breach can expose client tax returns, financial statements, payroll data, and bank account information.

The IRS, state boards, and cyber insurance companies are all raising the bar for accounting firm cybersecurity. Yet most firms lack the resources to implement enterprise-grade security on their own.

**The Cyber Grants Alliance provides free cybersecurity grants to CPA and accounting firms.** Get professional security assessments, staff training, and compliance support at no cost to your firm.

## Why CPAs Are Prime Targets

**Treasure Trove of Financial Data**
Your firm holds W-2s, 1099s, bank statements, tax returns, and financial records for thousands of taxpayers. This data sells for premium prices on the dark web and is used for identity theft, tax fraud, and business email compromise schemes.

**Tax Season Vulnerability**
During peak filing season, your staff is overworked and rushing. Cybercriminals know this and increase phishing attacks specifically targeting accounting firms from January through April.

**Wire Transfer Fraud**
Sophisticated attackers compromise firm email to send fraudulent wire transfer instructions to clients. A single successful wire fraud can cost your firm hundreds of thousands in liability and reputation damage.

**Regulatory Scrutiny**
The IRS mandates cybersecurity protections for e-file providers. State boards of accountancy are adding cybersecurity requirements to licensure. Cyber insurers are demanding specific controls before issuing policies. The bar is rising, and firms that don't meet it face penalties, lost clients, and professional liability.

## CPA-Specific Challenges We Address

**Client Data Protection**
You handle PII, financial data, and tax information for hundreds or thousands of clients. We help you implement encryption, access controls, and secure data handling practices that meet IRS and state board requirements.

**Secure Client Portals**
Many firms use consumer-grade file sharing that doesn't meet professional standards. We assess your client communication and file transfer methods and recommend secure alternatives.

**Remote Work Security**
Tax season often means working from home or client sites. We help you secure remote access, implement VPNs, and protect firm data on laptops and mobile devices.

**Vendor and Software Security**
Your tax software, document management systems, and cloud providers all represent potential attack vectors. We assess your technology stack and third-party risk.

**Incident Response Planning**
When (not if) a security incident occurs, you need a plan. We help you develop incident response procedures specific to accounting firms, including client notification requirements and regulatory reporting.

## The Real Cost of Inaction

**Wire Fraud Cases:** The average accounting firm wire fraud incident costs $250,000-$500,000 in stolen funds, plus legal fees, client notification costs, and reputation damage.

**Data Breach Costs:** Accounting firm data breaches average $400 per compromised record. A breach affecting 500 client files can cost $200,000+ in direct costs alone.

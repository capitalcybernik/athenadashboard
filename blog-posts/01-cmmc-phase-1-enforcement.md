The Department of Defense made it official. CMMC Phase 1 enforcement begins in **May 2026**. If you handle controlled unclassified information (CUI) and you are not compliant, you risk losing your contracts. Not next year. Not eventually. **Now.**

Here is what that means for defense contractors who have been waiting to see if CMMC would actually happen.

## The Rule Changed. The Grace Period Ended.

For years, defense contractors operated on a "get compliant when you can" timeline. Self-attestation was enough. The DoD trusted you to tell the truth about your cybersecurity.

That trust is gone.

Under CMMC Phase 1, contractors must:
- Prove NIST 800-171 compliance through documentation
- Pass third-party assessments (for Level 2 contracts)
- Maintain continuous compliance, not just check boxes once
- Show proof before contract award, not after

## What Happens If You Are Not Ready

Let us be direct about the consequences:

- **Contract ineligibility:** You cannot bid on new DoD contracts requiring CMMC
- **Contract termination:** Existing contracts may not be renewed
- **Prime contractor pressure:** Primes will drop non-compliant subs to protect their own compliance
- **Reputation damage:** Your SPRS score (Supplier Performance Risk System) becomes public knowledge

We have seen contractors lose $2M+ contracts because their SPRS score was too low. The score is public. Your competitors see it. Your customers see it.

## The 90-Day Reality

Most contractors underestimate how long compliance takes. Here is the honest timeline:

- **Gap assessment:** 1-2 weeks to know where you stand
- **Remediation:** 60-90 days to fix gaps (longer if you have serious issues)
- **Documentation:** 2-3 weeks to build your System Security Plan (SSP)
- **Third-party assessment:** 4-8 weeks to schedule and complete (if Level 2 required)

**Total: 90-120 days minimum**

If you start today, you might be ready by May. If you wait until April, you will not.

## What You Should Do This Week

Do not panic. Plan. Here is your immediate action list:

1. **Check your SPRS score:** If you do not know it, find out today. Go to https://www.sprs.csd.disa.mil/
2. **Schedule a gap assessment:** You need to know exactly what is broken before you can fix it
3. **Review your contracts:** Which ones require CUI handling? Those are your priority
4. **Assign an internal owner:** Someone needs to own this project, or it will slide

## Why This Matters Beyond Compliance

Here is the truth most contractors miss: CMMC compliance makes you a better business.

The security controls required by NIST 800-171 are the same controls that stop ransomware, prevent data breaches, and protect your intellectual property. We have seen compliant contractors avoid $500K+ breaches because they had the basics in place.

Compliance is not a tax. It is insurance that actually pays off.

## How Capital Cyber Helps

We specialize in CMMC compliance for small and mid-sized defense contractors. Not theory. Execution.

- **Gap assessments** that tell you exactly what to fix (and what you can ignore)
- **Remediation** that gets you compliant without breaking your budget
- **Documentation** that passes audit scrutiny
- **Assessment preparation** so you pass the first time

We have helped contractors go from SPRS scores of 45 to 110. We have helped others get compliant in 60 days when they thought it would take 6 months.

## The Bottom Line

CMMC Phase 1 is not a suggestion. It is a requirement with teeth. The contractors who start now will keep their contracts. The ones who wait will lose them.

You have about 90 days. Use them wisely.

Most businesses have an IT provider. They fix your computers when they break. They manage your servers. They are reactive.

Most businesses do not have a security partner. Someone who prevents computers from breaking. Who stops attackers before they reach your servers. Who makes compliance a competitive advantage instead of a checkbox.

**Capital Cyber is not an IT company that does security. We are a cybersecurity firm that happens to handle your IT.**

That distinction changes everything. Here is what it means for your business.

## The Three Models Explained

Understanding what you are actually buying matters. Most business owners do not know the difference between an MSP, MSSP, and MCP. They should.

### MSP: Managed Service Provider

**What they do:** Keep your computers running. Fix what breaks. Install software. Manage your network infrastructure.

**What they optimize for:** Uptime. Response time. Ticket closure rates.

**What they often miss:** Security is an afterthought. They patch monthly instead of daily. They configure for convenience instead of hardening. They treat antivirus as "good enough."

**The risk:** You are paying for operational support, not protection. When ransomware hits, the MSP invoices you for emergency recovery. They do not prevent the disaster.

**[IMAGE PLACEMENT 2: MSP Concept]**
*Suggested image:* Technician at desk surrounded by computer monitors, fix-it tools, tickets/requests flying in. Reactive posture. Maybe a clock showing "Response time: 15 minutes" but no security elements visible.
*Alt text:* "Traditional MSP model focuses on fixing IT problems, not preventing security threats"

### MSSP: Managed Security Service Provider

**What they do:** Monitor for threats 24/7. Manage firewalls. Run Security Operations Center (SOC). Hunt for attackers. Respond to incidents.

**What they optimize for:** Threat detection. Incident response. Mean time to detect (MTTD).

**What they often miss:** They alert you to problems but do not fix your underlying IT issues. They find the malware but do not patch the vulnerability that let it in. They are security-only, not integrated with operations.

**The risk:** You need both security monitoring AND infrastructure management. Two vendors mean gaps. Finger-pointing. "That is an IT problem, not a security problem."

**[IMAGE PLACEMENT 3: MSSP Concept]**
*Suggested image:* Security operations center with screens showing threat maps, alert dashboards, analysts watching monitors. Guard/protection imagery. But show lack of connection to actual business operations next to it.
*Alt text:* "MSSP provides security monitoring but often operates separately from IT operations"

### MCP: Managed Compliance Partner

**What they do:** Navigate regulatory requirements. Build compliance programs. Prepare you for audits. Map controls to frameworks like NIST, CMMC, HIPAA.

**What they optimize for:** Audit readiness. Documentation. Regulatory alignment.

**What they often miss:** Compliance without security is theater. They build paperwork without fixing the underlying risks. They get you through the audit but leave you vulnerable to actual attacks.

**The risk:** You pass the audit then get breached the next month. Your certificate is valid. Your data is stolen.

**[IMAGE PLACEMENT 4: MCP Concept]**
*Suggested image:* Stacks of compliance documents, checklists, audit certificates with checkmarks. But subtle warning signs: a small crack, or a hacker figure peeking from behind the paperwork. Convey "paper compliance vs real security."
*Alt text:* "Pure compliance focus without security integration creates false sense of protection"

## Why Capital Cyber Is Different

We built this company because we saw what happens when businesses piece together MSP + MSSP + MCP from different vendors:

**Gaps.** Each vendor assumes the other is handling something. Nobody owns the full picture.

**Cost.** Three vendors, three contracts, three sets of tools. 40-60% overhead from duplication.

**Blame.** When something breaks, your MSP blames your MSSP. Your MSSP says it is an IT configuration issue.

We fix this by delivering all three functions as one integrated service. But unlike an MSP that "bolted on" security, we built everything from a security-first foundation.

**[IMAGE PLACEMENT 5: Capital Cyber Model - THE KEY IMAGE]**
*Suggested image:* Pyramid or hierarchy showing:
- Foundation: Security-first architecture (hardening, zero-trust, defense in depth)
- Middle layer: Operational MSP services (delivered securely)
- Top: Compliance and governance (security-driven, not checkbox-driven)
- Peak: 24/7 SOC and threat response

Use strong visual hierarchy. Capital Cyber branding. Convey "integrated" and "security-first."
*Alt text:* "Capital Cyber's integrated model: Security-first foundation with MSP, MSSP, and MCP as unified service"

## What Security-First IT Actually Looks Like

Here is the practical difference. Compare the same scenario handled by a traditional MSP versus Capital Cyber.

### Scenario: New Employee Onboarding

**Traditional MSP approach:**
- Order laptop
- Install standard software image
- Add to domain
- Set password to "Temp123!" (user will change it... eventually)
- Close ticket

**Capital Cyber approach:**
- Order laptop with pre-hardened image
- Configure zero-trust device enrollment (no domain join, no lateral movement risk)
- Enforce MFA before first login
- Set 16-character randomly generated password (never "temporary")
- Apply least-privilege access (user sees only what they need)
- Enable full disk encryption automatically
- Baseline security settings with monitoring enabled
- Document in compliance system
- Close ticket, log to security dashboard

Same task. Entirely different risk profile.

**[IMAGE PLACEMENT 6: Side-by-Side Comparison]**
*Suggested image:* Split screen comparison showing:
Left (Traditional MSP): 5 simple steps, basic icons, lots of white space, looks "efficient"
Right (Capital Cyber): 8 detailed steps, security shield icons, checkmarks, layered protection imagery. Use color coding (yellow/orange for basic, green/blue for secure).

## The Numbers That Matter

We do not just claim to be different. We measure it.

**Response time to critical threats:** Under 15 minutes (industry average: 4 hours)

**Mean time to patch critical vulnerabilities:** 24 hours (industry average: 60+ days)

**Password security assessments conducted in 2024:** 20,000+ (we test your passwords against real breach databases)

**Client retention rate:** 100% (three years running)

**Average client contract length:** 36 months

**Compliance audit pass rate:** 100% (when following our recommended program)

**Ransomware incidents for managed clients:** 0

**[IMAGE PLACEMENT 8: Stats/Numbers Infographic]**
*Suggested image:* Bold statistics display showing the key numbers above. Use large typography for key figures (<15 min, 24 hours, 20,000+, 100%, etc.). Professional, confident design. Capital Cyber brand colors.
*Alt text:* "Capital Cyber performance metrics and security outcomes"

## Who This Is For (And Who It Is Not)

We are not the right fit for everyone. We work best with:

**Defense contractors** — CMMC compliance is not optional, and gaps are expensive
**CPA firms** — Tax season wire fraud can destroy a firm
**Mortgage companies** — High-value wire transfers make you a prime target
**Professional services** — Your client data is your business
**Manufacturers** — OT/IT convergence creates unique security challenges

We are probably overkill if you:
- Have 5 employees and no sensitive data
- Use only cloud apps with no compliance requirements
- Never handle wire transfers or sensitive client information
- Have zero cybersecurity budget

**[IMAGE PLACEMENT 9: Ideal Client Profile]**
*Suggested image:* Silhouettes or icons representing different industries we serve: defense contractor (fighter jet/medal icon), CPA (calculator/tax form), mortgage (house/keys), professional services (briefcase), manufacturing (factory gear). Clean, professional, visually distinct.
*Alt text:* "Industries served by Capital Cyber: defense contractors, CPAs, mortgage companies, professional services, manufacturers"

## The Real Cost of Getting This Wrong

We will be direct: hiring an MSP that "also does security" is cheaper upfront. About 30-40% cheaper in year one.

But when you factor in:
- The cost of a ransomware incident (average: $1.85M for SMBs)
- Business interruption (average downtime: 21 days)
- Regulatory fines for compliance failures
- Lost clients after a breach
- Your time dealing with multiple vendors

The "cheaper" option becomes catastrophically expensive.

We have seen companies spend $200K on recovery after choosing a $99/month MSP that promised "enterprise security included."

Security is insurance that actually pays off. Doing it right costs less than doing it twice.

**[IMAGE PLACEMENT 10: Cost Comparison]**
*Suggested image:* Simple bar chart or comparison showing:
- Year 1: Traditional MSP ($X) vs Capital Cyber ($X+40%)
- Year 2-3: Traditional MSP + incident cost ($X + $$$$) vs Capital Cyber ($X annually)
- Conclusion: Long-term cost of cheap IT

Make it visual and impactful. Use red for incident costs.

## How to Engage With Us

We do not do cookie-cutter assessments. Every business has different risks, different compliance needs, different budgets.

**Step 1: Conversation**
Call us. Tell us about your business. We will ask questions you might not have considered. This is not a sales pitch. It is a security assessment disguised as a conversation.

**Step 2: Gap Analysis**
If it makes sense, we conduct a thorough assessment. We find the gaps. We prioritize them by risk and cost. You get a clear roadmap.

**Step 3: Implementation**
We become your security partner. MSP, MSSP, MCP — everything integrated. One vendor. One throat to choke. No gaps.

**[IMAGE PLACEMENT 11: Engagement Process]**
*Suggested image:* Three-step flowchart showing: 1) Conversation (phone/chat icon) → 2) Gap Analysis (magnifying glass/checklist icon) → 3) Partnership (handshake/integrated shield icon). Clean, simple, professional.

## The Bottom Line

IT companies fix what breaks. Security partners prevent what would break you.

You can hire someone to manage your computers. Or you can hire someone to protect your business.

**We do both. But we do security first.**

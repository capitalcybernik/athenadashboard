Here is a statistic that should terrify every CPA firm: **ransomware attacks on accounting firms spike 300% during tax season.**

It makes sense. You are distracted. You are busy. Your guard is down. And you are sitting on exactly what cybercriminals want: thousands of Social Security numbers, bank account details, and financial records.

This guide covers what CPA firms need to know to survive tax season without becoming a headline.

## Why Tax Season Makes You a Target

Cybercriminals are not stupid. They understand your business cycle better than you might think.

**January through April:**
- Firms are understaffed and overworked
- New clients bring new data (often via insecure email)
- Staff work longer hours, make more mistakes
- IT security becomes an afterthought to deadlines
- Wire transfers for tax payments create fraud opportunities

Attackers know you will pay the ransom because you cannot afford to lose two weeks of tax season to system downtime.

## The Three Attacks CPA Firms Face

### 1. Ransomware (The Nuclear Option)

Ransomware encrypts your files and demands payment. For a CPA firm in March, this is a business-ending event. You cannot file extensions for 200 clients if your systems are locked.

**Real case:** A Virginia CPA firm was hit March 15th. They paid $75,000 in ransom. Their systems were down for 11 days. They lost 40% of their clients by year-end.

### 2. Wire Fraud (The Silent Killer)

Attackers compromise your email, learn your clients wire transfer patterns, then intercept payments. They change bank account numbers at the last minute. By the time anyone notices, the money is in a foreign account.

**The numbers:** Average wire fraud loss for CPA firms is $125,000 per incident. Recovery rate: under 10%.

### 3. Data Theft (The Slow Burn)

Instead of obvious ransomware, some attackers quietly steal client data over months. They sell it on the dark web or use it for identity theft. You might not discover the breach for 6-12 months.

## The Specific Vulnerabilities of Tax Season

### Insecure Client Data Sharing

Clients email W-2s, 1099s, and bank statements. These emails are not encrypted. If their email is compromised, your client data is exposed. If your email is compromised, every client who emailed you is exposed.

**Fix:** Implement a secure client portal. Never accept tax documents via regular email.

### Overworked Staff

Your staff are working 60-hour weeks. They are clicking links they should not. They are skipping security steps to save time. They are the easiest target.

**Fix:** Brief refresher training before tax season. Create simple checklists. Make security faster, not harder.

### Third-Party Software Risks

Tax software, document management systems, e-signature tools. Each one is a potential entry point. Attackers target popular CPA software because one breach gives them hundreds of firms.

**Fix:** Enable multi-factor authentication on every system. Patch immediately when updates are released.

## The Wire Fraud Playbook (How It Actually Happens)

This is worth understanding in detail because it is the most common and costly attack.

**Week 1:** Attacker sends phishing email to your staff. Someone clicks. Attacker now has email access.

**Week 2-4:** Attacker watches. Learns who handles wire transfers. Learns your client communication style.

**Week 5:** Client emails you about making a tax payment. Attacker intercepts. Replies with "updated wire instructions." Account number is now the attacker's.

**Week 6:** You wire $87,000 to the wrong account. Attacker moves it offshore within hours.

**Week 7:** You discover the fraud. FBI says recovery is unlikely. Your E&O insurance covers $50K. You eat $37K plus reputation damage.

**Prevention is simple:** Verify every wire instruction change via phone call to a known number. Not email. Phone.

## A 10-Point Tax Season Security Checklist

Print this. Check it twice.

1. ✅ Enable MFA on all email, tax software, and financial systems
2. ✅ Set up a secure client portal (no tax docs via email)
3. ✅ Verify wire instructions by phone (not email) for every transfer
4. ✅ Backup daily to offline/cloud storage (ransomware cannot touch it)
5. ✅ Brief staff on phishing before January (30 minutes saves millions)
6. ✅ Update and patch all software before tax season starts
7. ✅ Review cyber insurance coverage (is wire fraud covered?)
8. ✅ Disable remote access for staff who do not need it
9. ✅ Create an incident response plan (who do you call at 2 AM?)
10. ✅ Test your backups (can you actually restore files?)

## What If You Are Hit During Tax Season?

Disconnect from the internet immediately. Call your cyber insurance. Call a forensics firm. Do not pay the ransom without professional advice (sometimes negotiation works, sometimes recovery is possible without paying).

Most importantly: **Have a plan before you need it.** The firms that survive attacks are the ones that practiced their response.

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Hi {{contact.first_name}},</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">If your office burned down tomorrow, how long would it take to get back to work?</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Not the building. The data. Your client files. Your accounting records. Your project documents. Your email history. Everything your business runs on.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Most businesses have some kind of backup. Maybe it's an external hard drive sitting next to the server. Maybe it's a cloud sync through OneDrive or Google Drive. The problem is that most of those "backups" aren't real backups. They're file syncing, which means if ransomware encrypts your files, the encrypted versions sync right over your good copies. Or the backup drive is connected to the same network, so ransomware encrypts that too.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">A real backup strategy has three things: it's automatic (nobody has to remember to do it), it's offsite (not sitting in the same building or on the same network), and it's immutable (ransomware can't delete or encrypt it). You also need to know it actually works, which means regular test restores, not just hoping it'll be fine when you need it.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">We set up and manage backup and disaster recovery for all of our clients. Daily backups, stored offsite, immutable, and tested regularly. If something happens, whether it's ransomware, hardware failure, accidental deletion, or anything else, we can get you back up and running. Not in days. In hours.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">If you're not 100% confident you could recover your business data tomorrow if everything went sideways, let's fix that.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Hi {{contact.first_name}},</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">You know those Windows update notifications you keep clicking "remind me later" on? Attackers are counting on that.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Software updates aren't just about new features. Most of them include patches for security vulnerabilities that have already been discovered and, in many cases, are already being exploited. When you delay updates, you're leaving known doors open that attackers have the keys to.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">And it's not just Windows. It's your web browsers, your PDF readers, your accounting software, your VPN client, your printer firmware. Every piece of software on every device in your organization is a potential entry point if it's not kept current.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">The challenge for most businesses is that patching is tedious, it can break things if done wrong, and nobody wants to deal with it. So it gets pushed off. A week turns into a month turns into six months, and suddenly you're running software with known vulnerabilities that have been public knowledge since last year.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">We manage patching for all of our clients. That means every device gets updated on a regular schedule, tested to make sure nothing breaks, and verified to confirm the patches actually applied. Critical security patches get fast tracked. And you never have to think about it.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Every compliance framework requires it. Every insurance carrier asks about it. And it's one of the most common gaps we find when we do assessments for new clients.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">If you're not sure when your systems were last updated, that's probably your answer.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;"><a href="https://capital-cyber.com/rick" style="color:#1a5276;font-weight:bold;">Book a quick call with Rick</a> and we'll take a look.</p>

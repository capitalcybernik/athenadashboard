<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Hi {{contact.first_name}},</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">The federal agency responsible for helping protect American businesses from cyberattacks just lost a third of its workforce.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">CISA (the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) has had entire divisions shut down over the past year. Senior leaders in ransomware response, threat hunting, and secure software development have left. Two information sharing centers that served state and local governments have folded.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">This isn't a partisan talking point. Republican Congressman Andrew Garbarino, who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, said it plainly: "A lot of the best and brightest have left the agency... it definitely leaves us all vulnerable." Democrat Bennie Thompson said: "We are weaker because of CISA's lack of manpower."</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">What does this mean for your business? The threat intelligence sharing, vulnerability alerts, and incident support that CISA provided are being scaled back or eliminated. The safety net that existed for small and mid-sized businesses is getting thinner.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Large enterprises will absorb this. They have their own security teams and massive budgets. Small and mid-sized businesses can't.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">The organizations that previously relied on CISA are now turning to private sector partners. That shift is already happening, and it's exactly why companies like ours exist.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">At Capital Cyber, we provide 24/7 monitoring, proactive threat hunting, vulnerability management, incident response, and compliance support for the businesses that need it most. The government can't be your cybersecurity plan anymore. You need a real partner.</p>

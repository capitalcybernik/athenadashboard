<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Hi {{contact.first_name}},</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Our team cracked over 20,000 passwords in 2024. Not for criminals. For businesses that wanted to know how strong their passwords actually were.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">The results were eye opening. Passwords like "Company2024!" and "Welcome1" and "Summer2024" showed up over and over. Patterns that feel secure but that cracking tools blow through in seconds. People think adding a number and an exclamation point makes a password strong. It doesn't.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Here's why this matters: if we can crack your passwords, so can an attacker. And they don't even need to crack them most of the time. They buy leaked credentials from data breaches, try the most common passwords, or use automated tools that run through millions of combinations per second.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">A penetration test that includes password auditing shows you exactly how vulnerable your organization is. We extract password hashes (securely, with your permission), run them through the same tools attackers use, and show you what percentage of your team's passwords we cracked and how fast.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">For most companies, the results are a wake up call. It's not about shaming anyone. It's about understanding the risk so you can fix it with better password policies, a password manager, and MFA.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">We also run full penetration tests that go beyond passwords: testing your network, your applications, your email security, your physical security. It's the best way to find out what an attacker would find if they targeted your business.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Curious how your organization's passwords would hold up? We can find out.</p>

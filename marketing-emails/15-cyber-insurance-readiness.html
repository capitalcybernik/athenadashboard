<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Hi {{contact.first_name}},</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">If you have cyber liability insurance, there's a question worth asking: would your carrier actually pay out if you filed a claim today?</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">More and more, the answer is no. Carriers have gotten aggressive about verifying that policyholders actually have the security controls they claimed on their application. If you checked the box for MFA but half your team isn't using it, if you said you have endpoint protection but it's just basic antivirus, if you claimed regular backups but they haven't been tested in a year... that claim can be denied.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">I've lived through this. The company I was at paid $500,000 in ransom after a ransomware attack. The insurance company paid out $700,000 because we had actually done the work. We had the controls. We could prove it. Today, the bar is even higher. Carriers are sending in auditors. They're running external scans of your network before they even write the policy.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">The controls they're looking for are pretty consistent across carriers: MFA, endpoint detection, email security, backups, patch management, security awareness training, and incident response planning. If any of those are missing or misconfigured, your premium goes up, your coverage goes down, or you get denied entirely.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">We help our clients get insurance ready and stay that way. When that renewal questionnaire comes around, every answer is honest and backed by evidence. That means lower premiums and actual coverage when something happens.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">If your renewal is coming up and you're not sure where you stand, let's talk before the carrier does.</p>

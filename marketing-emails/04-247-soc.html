<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Hi {{contact.first_name}},</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">When most business owners hear "24/7 Security Operations Center," they assume it's something only big corporations can afford. Dedicated analysts watching screens around the clock, six figure salaries, expensive tools. That used to be true.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">It's not anymore.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">The way we've set things up at Capital Cyber, our clients get real 24/7 SOC monitoring as part of their managed security package. Not a watered down version. Not "we'll check the logs on Monday." Actual around the clock monitoring with real analysts who respond to threats in real time.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Here's what that looks like in practice: if someone tries to log into your systems at 2 AM from a country you don't do business in, we catch it. If a device on your network starts behaving oddly on a Saturday afternoon, we see it. If ransomware starts encrypting files at midnight, we're already isolating the device before it spreads.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Most cyberattacks happen outside business hours. Attackers know that. They wait until Friday evening or Sunday morning because they know nobody's watching. That's exactly why 24/7 monitoring matters.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">For businesses handling sensitive data, whether that's financial records, government contract information, or client files, a SOC isn't a luxury anymore. Insurance carriers are asking about it. Compliance frameworks require it. And the cost of not having it is a whole lot more than the cost of having it.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">If you've been told SOC monitoring is out of your budget, we should talk. You might be surprised.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Hi {{contact.first_name}},</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">There's a good chance your company's credentials are already for sale on the dark web. Not because you did anything wrong, but because some service you or your employees signed up for got breached, and those leaked credentials are now sitting in a database that anyone can buy for a few dollars.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">The problem is that people reuse passwords. If someone on your team used their work email and the same password for a third party service that got breached, an attacker now has a working username and password for your systems. They don't have to hack anything. They just log in.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Dark web monitoring watches for your company's email addresses, domains, and credentials showing up in breach databases, paste sites, and underground marketplaces. When something shows up, you get alerted so you can force a password change before anyone uses those stolen credentials against you.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">We run dark web monitoring for all of our clients. When we onboard a new company, the first scan almost always turns up compromised credentials. It's not a matter of if, it's how many and how recently.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Paired with MFA and strong password policies, dark web monitoring closes one of the most common attack paths we see. It's a simple layer that can save you from a very expensive problem.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Want to know if your company's credentials are already out there? We can run a scan and show you the results. No cost.</p>

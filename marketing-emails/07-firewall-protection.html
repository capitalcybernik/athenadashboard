<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Hi {{contact.first_name}},</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Quick question: when was the last time someone looked at your firewall?</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Not "is it plugged in." I mean actually reviewed the rules, checked the firmware, looked at the logs, and made sure it's doing what it's supposed to do.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Most businesses have a firewall. It was set up years ago by whoever handled IT at the time, and nobody has touched it since. The problem is that a firewall you set and forget is barely better than no firewall at all. Default passwords, outdated firmware, rules that are too permissive, ports left open that shouldn't be. We see this constantly.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">A properly managed firewall does a lot more than block traffic. It segments your network so that if one area gets compromised, the attacker can't just walk across to everything else. It logs traffic so you can see what's coming in and going out. It enforces policies that keep your environment locked down the way it should be.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">For businesses with multiple locations or remote workers (which is most businesses now), firewall management gets even more important. Every office, every remote connection is an entry point. If those aren't secured and monitored consistently, you've got gaps.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">We manage firewalls for all of our clients. That means regular firmware updates, rule reviews, log monitoring, and configuration changes as your business evolves. When compliance auditors or insurance carriers ask about your perimeter security, you've got real answers.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">If your firewall hasn't been touched in a while, it's worth a quick look.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Hi {{contact.first_name}},</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">If your team is logging into email, remote desktop, cloud apps, or VPN with just a username and password, you're one phishing email away from a breach.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">That's not an exaggeration. Stolen credentials are the number one way attackers get into business systems. They buy leaked passwords on the dark web, they harvest them through phishing, or they just guess them. And once they're in with a valid username and password, they look like a legitimate user. Your systems won't flag it. Your team won't notice.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds a second step. Even if someone has the password, they can't get in without the second factor, usually a code on your phone or a push notification you have to approve. It's simple. It's effective. And it blocks the vast majority of credential based attacks.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Every cyber insurance carrier now requires MFA. CMMC requires it. The IRS expects it for tax professionals. It's not optional anymore in any regulated industry, and honestly, it shouldn't be optional for anyone.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">The pushback we hear is usually "my team thinks it's annoying." Fair enough. But you know what's more annoying? Explaining to your clients that their data was stolen because someone's password was "Company2024."</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">We roll out MFA for all of our clients across every access point. Email, VPN, cloud applications, admin portals. And we configure it so it's as painless as possible for the people using it every day.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">If MFA isn't in place across your organization right now, this is probably the single highest impact change you can make.</p>

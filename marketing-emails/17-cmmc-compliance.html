<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Hi {{contact.first_name}},</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">If your company does any work with the Department of Defense, whether as a prime contractor or anywhere in the supply chain, CMMC is coming for you. Phase 1 enforcement has started, and it's no longer something you can push to next quarter.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">CMMC (Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification) requires defense contractors to prove they meet specific cybersecurity standards before they can bid on or keep DoD contracts. Not just say they do. Prove it, with documentation, technical controls, and in many cases a third party assessment.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">For most small and mid-sized contractors, especially in manufacturing and construction, this is overwhelming. The requirements map to NIST 800-171, which has 110 security controls. If you're starting from scratch, that's a lot of ground to cover.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Here's the thing: you don't have to figure it out alone. This is what we do every day at Capital Cyber. We help contractors go from wherever they are today to CMMC ready. That includes the gap assessment, the remediation plan, the technical implementation, the documentation, and the ongoing management to keep you compliant after you pass.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">We also built a tool called CMMC Ready Now that helps you track your progress, manage your System Security Plan, and know exactly where you stand at any point. It takes a process that feels impossible and makes it manageable.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">If you have DoD contracts or you're in the supply chain of someone who does, the time to start is now. Companies that wait until a contract requires it will be scrambling. Companies that start now will be ready.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;"><a href="https://capital-cyber.com/rick" style="color:#1a5276;font-weight:bold;">Book a quick call with Rick</a> and we'll assess where you stand.</p>

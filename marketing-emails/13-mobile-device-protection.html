<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Hi {{contact.first_name}},</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">How many people on your team check work email from their phone? Open client files? Access your cloud apps? Probably most of them.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Now, how many of those phones have any kind of security management on them? Probably none.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">That's one of the biggest blind spots in business cybersecurity right now. Companies invest in protecting their computers and their network, but the phone in everyone's pocket has access to the same email, the same files, and the same apps. And it's completely unmanaged.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">A lost phone without proper protections is a data breach waiting to happen. Someone picks it up, and they potentially have access to your email, your client list, your internal documents, maybe even your banking app. No password cracking required if there's no lock screen or if the email app stays logged in.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Mobile device protection doesn't mean taking over your employees' personal phones. It means putting sensible policies in place: requiring a lock screen, encrypting business data on the device, being able to remotely wipe company information if a phone is lost or stolen, and detecting if the device has been compromised.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">We deploy mobile protection for our clients that covers both company-owned and personal devices used for work. It's lightweight, it doesn't invade anyone's privacy, and it closes a gap that most businesses don't even realize they have.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">If your team uses their phones for work (and they do), this is worth talking about.</p>

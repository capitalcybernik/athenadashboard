<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Hi {{contact.first_name}},</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Do you know what Mark from accounting installed on his computer last Tuesday?</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Probably not. And that's the problem.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Employees install things all the time. A free PDF converter. A browser extension that looked useful. A "productivity tool" someone recommended on Reddit. Most of the time it's harmless. Sometimes it's not. And sometimes it's the exact thing an attacker uses to get into your network.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">Application whitelisting flips the script. Instead of trying to block every bad thing (which is impossible), you only allow the applications your business actually needs to run. Everything else gets blocked automatically. If it's not on the approved list, it doesn't run. Period.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">This is one of the most effective security controls that exists, and it's one of the least talked about. Insurance carriers love it. CMMC requires it. And it stops a massive percentage of malware dead in its tracks because most malware needs to execute a program to do damage, and if that program isn't whitelisted, it simply can't run.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">The common pushback is "but my employees need flexibility." We get it. That's why we manage the whitelist for our clients. Need a new tool for a project? We approve it. Someone tries to install something sketchy? It gets blocked and we get notified. Your team keeps working, and you don't have to worry about what's running on your machines.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 18px;">If you're not sure what's installed across your company's computers right now, that's probably worth finding out.</p>

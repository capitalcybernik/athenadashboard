## What is OpenClaw?
Ares (that's me) runs inside OpenClaw. You chat with me via:
- **Telegram:** @Ares2040_bot (primary)
- **Anywhere:** I receive messages, respond accordingly

I have tools for:
- Content creation (blogs, web pages, emails)
- Social media (drafts, not auto-posting)
- Research (SEO, competitors, grants)
- Task tracking (Dart AI)
- Coding (if needed)

---

## How to Give Me Work

### Good Requests (I can do these)
| Task | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Write content** | "Draft a blog post on ransomware for dentists" |
| **Edit/rewrite** | "Tighten up the text on the Virginia CMMC page. Less fluff." |
| **Research** | "What are competitors ranking for 'CMMC Virginia'?" |
| **Website changes** | "Add a CTA to the end of the managed IT page" |
| **Status check** | "What did you finish yesterday?" |
| **Task management** | "Add a task to review the Q1 report" |

### Don't Ask For (I can't/won't)
- "Post this to Facebook" — Draft only, you approve and post
- "Email Rick" — I can draft, you approve and send
- "Delete that file" without confirming with Nikhil
- "Send this to everyone on LinkedIn" — No bulk outbound without approval
- "What's the root password?" — Never asking, never revealing

## Command Reference

### Daily Use
| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/new` | Reset the current chat (fresh start) |
| `/status` | Check my current model and session info |
| `/reasoning on/off` | Toggle detailed thinking (use if you need deep analysis) |

### Messaging Me
**Just talk normally.** Examples:
- "Hey Ares, draft me 5 Facebook post ideas for this week"
- "Rework this line: It sounds like AI wrote it"
- "What competitors rank #1 for 'vCISO Northern Virginia'?"

---

## What Happens When You Send Work

### I Log Everything to Dart AI
Every task I complete gets logged so you can review:
- **Board:** "Master Control/Ares Tasks"
- **Link:** https://app.itsdart.com
- **Access:** Log in with your Dart AI credentials

### I Communicate Status
| Timeline | What I'll Tell You |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Quick wins** (< 10 min) | I'll just do it and confirm |
| **Medium tasks** (10-60 min) | "Working on it, ETA 30 min" |
| **Big projects** (> 1 hr) | ETA + progress updates |
| **Delays** | Immediate notification with new timeline |

## The Request → Result Workflow

```
You: "Draft a blog post on CMMC for manufacturers"

Ares: Parses, maybe asks clarifying questions
      ("What angle: cost savings, common mistakes, or overview?")

You: "Go with common mistakes"

Ares: Creates drafts, sends for review
      "Here are 3 angles. Pick one or combine."

You: "#2 but tighten the intro"

Ares: Updates, sends final

You: "Looks good, log it."

Ares: Logs task to Dart AI as "Blog post: CMMC mistakes for manufacturers - Done"
```

---

## Types of Content I Can Produce

### Written
- Blog posts (full drafts)
- Web page copy
- Social media posts (Facebook, LinkedIn)
- Email drafts
- Reports and analysis

### Research
- Competitor SEO analysis
- Keyword gap analysis
- Grant opportunity research
- Industry trends

### Technical
- WordPress content updates
- Landing page creation
- Form embeds and CTAs
- Internal linking audits

---

## Style & Tone

### How I Write (by default)
- Direct. No fluff. No "In today's digital landscape..."
- Colons, not dashes in headers
- Confident, professional, slightly sardonic (Ares' voice)
- Specific numbers when we have them (20,000+ passwords cracked in 2024)

### How to Override
- "Tone: Make it warmer"
- "Tone: More formal"
- "This sounds like legal/technical. Dumb it down."
- "Use bullet points, not paragraphs."

---

## Escalation: When to Loop in Nikhil

**Ask first before I do:**
- Anything involving actual sends (email, social posts)
- Deleting content or files
- Changes to your website's navigation or structure
- Access to Cynet, credit card info, or financial accounts
- Creating new accounts anywhere

**I'll auto-escalate if:**
- I see something looks like a security risk
- A task seems to conflict with other work
- I'm uncertain about scope

---

## Quick Examples

### ✅ Good Request
> "Write a Facebook post about the 51 CMMC pages we just published. Punchy, not salesy. End with a question to drive engagement."

### ❌ Bad Request
> "Fix the website." (Too vague. I'll ask what specifically.)

### ✅ Good Request
> "Audit our competitors for 'CMMC consultant Virginia Beach'. Report: who's ranking, what they're saying, what keywords they use."

### ❌ Bad Request
> "Make us rank #1." (SEO doesn't work like that. I can tell you the gaps, not guarantee rankings.)

## Emergency / Problem Solving

### If Something's Wrong
**Symptom:** I'm not responding or giving weird answers  
**Fix:** Type `/new` to reset the session

### If I Seem "Stuck"
Sometimes sessions get stale. `/new` fixes most issues.

### If You Need Me Right Now
- Telegram is the fastest
- No need to wait for heartbeats
- Just message

## Key Principles

1. **I remember.** Check MEMORY.md or ask "What did we decide about X?"
2. **I log.** Every task hits Dart AI. Review there.
3. **I confirm.** Big or external actions need your go-ahead.
4. **I'm direct.** Ask me anything. No corporate speak needed.

## What Makes Athena Different
Athena is not a chatbot. She's a strategic operator who understands the intersection of cybersecurity services, federal compliance requirements, and the sales cycle for B2B security firms. She reads call transcripts and tells you what the prospect actually needs. She monitors federal contracts and tells you who needs CMMC help before they know it themselves. She writes content that ranks and converts. And she never sleeps.

**Challenge:** First-time DoD contractor with no formal cybersecurity program
**CMMC Level:** Level 1 (FCI handling only)

### FAQS

**H2:** Common CMMC Questions

**Q: How long does CMMC compliance take?**
A: CMMC Level 1 typically takes 4-6 weeks. CMMC Level 2 requires 12-16 weeks for most small-to-medium businesses. The timeline depends on your current security posture and the complexity of your IT environment.

**Q: Do I need GCC High for CMMC Level 2?**
A: Not necessarily. Many small and medium contractors can achieve Level 2 compliance with properly configured commercial Microsoft 365 and Azure environments. GCC High is typically only required for large enterprises or those handling ITAR data. We assess your specific needs and recommend the most cost-effective approach.

**Q: What's the difference between NIST 800-171 and CMMC?**
A: NIST 800-171 is the security standard. CMMC is the certification program that verifies you've implemented those standards. Think of NIST as the requirements and CMMC as the test you pass to prove compliance.

**Q: Can I do a self-assessment for CMMC Level 2?**
A: No. CMMC Level 2 requires assessment by an authorized C3PAO (Certified Third-Party Assessment Organization). Only Level 1 allows self-assessment. We prepare you for your C3PAO assessment and can connect you with trusted assessment partners.

**Q: What happens if I fail my CMMC assessment?**
A: You receive a list of deficiencies and have time to remediate them. About 40% of first-time assessments identify findings. Our clients typically pass on the first attempt because we conduct thorough readiness assessments before scheduling official C3PAO evaluations.

**Q: How much does a C3PAO assessment cost?**
A: C3PAO assessments typically cost $15,000 - $50,000 depending on organization size and complexity. This is separate from implementation costs. The DoD estimates total assessment and affirmation costs around $104,670 for Level 2, though small businesses often pay less.

**Q: What's an SPRS score and why does it matter?**
A: The Supplier Performance Risk System (SPRS) score reflects your NIST 800-171 compliance level. DoD contracts now require minimum scores. We help you calculate, optimize, and maintain your SPRS score.

**Q: Do subcontractors need CMMC certification?**
A: Yes. If your company handles FCI or CUI as a subcontractor, you need the same CMMC level as the prime contractor. This requirement flows down the entire supply chain.

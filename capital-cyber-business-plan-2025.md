# Capital Cyber Business Plan

## Executive Summary

Capital Cyber is a cybersecurity firm born out of necessity and driven by purpose. Founded by Megan Bennett and Nikhil Bon, the company was established in response to a devastating \$500,000 ransomware attack that profoundly impacted their former company. This firsthand experience with the consequences of inadequate cybersecurity fuels Capital Cyber's mission: to protect what matters by delivering accessible cybersecurity solutions that transform vulnerability into resilience, enabling businesses to pursue their purpose with confidence.

Capital Cyber operates at the unique intersection of mission and market opportunity. The cybersecurity landscape is evolving rapidly, with SMBs facing unprecedented challenges, including rising compliance requirements, increasing sophistication of cyber threats, and limited access to enterprise-grade security solutions. With 60% of small businesses closing within six months of a cyber-attack, the need for affordable, scalable, and effective cybersecurity services has never been more urgent.

### Key Metrics

-   Current Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR): \$14,434
-   Client Retention Rate: 100%
-   Average Contract Duration: 36 months
-   Partner Network: Growing nationwide presence

Capital Cyber's business model is built on long-term client relationships, reflected in its 100% retention rate and multi-year contracts. The company's Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) demonstrates steady growth, while its expanding partner network positions it for nationwide scalability.

## Core Principles

"To protect what matters by delivering accessible cybersecurity solutions that transform vulnerability into resilience, enabling businesses to pursue their purpose with confidence."

### Vision Statement

"To pioneer a future where cybersecurity is accessible to all businesses regardless of size, creating resilient communities of protected organizations that can fulfill their purpose rather than worry about digital threats."

### Core Values

#### 1. INTEGRITY

**We act with unwavering honesty and ethical principles in all interactions, maintaining the highest standards of trustworthiness with clients, partners, and team members.**

In practice: We are transparent about our capabilities, honest in our assessments, and ethical in our business practices. We never compromise our values for profit or convenience.

#### 2. EXCELLENCE

**We pursue continuous improvement and mastery in our field, staying ahead of threats through relentless learning and innovation.**

In practice: We treat client information with the utmost care, develop our team members' potential, and use our expertise as a resource to be shared for the benefit of others.

#### 5. SERVANT LEADERSHIP

**We prioritize the needs of those we serve - clients, team members, and community - placing their security and success above our own interests.**

In practice: We listen before we speak, seek to understand before being understood, and measure our success by the security and success of those we serve.

## Market Opportunity

The cybersecurity landscape is evolving rapidly, and small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are increasingly vulnerable to cyber threats. Capital Cyber is uniquely positioned to address this critical market need. Below are key factors driving the demand for our services:

### High Risk for SMBs

-   60% of small businesses close within six months of a cyber attack due to financial losses, reputational damage, and operational disruptions.
-   SMBs often lack the resources or expertise to implement robust cybersecurity measures, making them prime targets for cybercriminals.

### Rising Compliance Requirements

-   Industries such as healthcare, financial services, professional services, and government contracting face increasing regulatory requirements (e.g., HIPAA, SEC guidelines, GDPR, CMMC).
-   SMBs must navigate complex compliance landscapes while ensuring data protection and avoiding costly penalties.

### Increasing Cyber Threats

-   Cyber threats targeting SMBs are growing in sophistication and frequency, including ransomware attacks, phishing schemes, and insider threats.
-   SMBs accounted for nearly 43% of all cyberattacks in recent years, highlighting their vulnerability.

### Limited Access to Enterprise-Grade Security Solutions

-   Many SMBs struggle to afford enterprise-grade security tools and services that larger organizations use to mitigate risks.
-   Capital Cyber bridges this gap by offering affordable, scalable solutions tailored to SMB needs without compromising on quality.

### Remote Work Challenges

-   The shift to remote work has introduced new vulnerabilities in endpoint security, cloud systems, and employee access controls.
-   SMBs require innovative solutions to secure their distributed workforce effectively.

## Business Model

### Revenue Streams

Capital Cyber generates revenue through two primary channels. The first is direct services, which account for \$14,434 in monthly recurring revenue (MRR) and include 24/7 SOC monitoring, managed IT security, and compliance maintenance. These services are structured as long-term contracts averaging 36 months, with a 100% client retention rate. Project-based assessments, such as penetration testing and compliance gap analysis, provide additional revenue, typically from \$5,000 to \$25,000 per engagement. Compliance consulting services, including HIPAA and CMMC certification support, further diversify revenue by addressing regulatory demands for healthcare providers and government contractors.

The second pillar of the revenue model is the Partner Program, which drives growth through strategic alliances. Partners earn up to 20% commission on net profits for referrals, with recurring revenue sharing on multi-year contracts. Joint marketing initiatives, co-hosted webinars, and lead-sharing agreements amplify reach while reducing customer acquisition costs.

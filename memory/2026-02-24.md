# 2026-02-24 — Tuesday

## Strategy Pivot
- Nikhil directed: focus on **manufacturing and construction companies** needing CMMC compliance
- These are defense supply chain companies that must comply but lack in-house cybersecurity
- Updated verticals in MEMORY.md

## Standing Orders Added
- All tasks/strategy updates → always log to Dart AI + memory notes
- Daily strategy drops → post to Discord #daily-strategy

## Tuesday Tasks (Revised)
1. Research 3 manufacturing & construction industry associations (NAM, AGC, NIST MEP)
2. LinkedIn article: CMMC mistakes costing manufacturing/construction firms defense contracts
3. Find 5 federal cybersecurity grants for CGA (targeting manufacturing/construction)
4. Optimize CGA → Capital Cyber conversion path (messaging for manufacturers/contractors)

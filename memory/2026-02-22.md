## Weekly Sales Performance Review (Feb 21 Meeting - Nikhil & Rick)

### Scorecard Reality Check
- **Rick:** 0 opportunities opened this week (target: 5/week)
- **Will Fortune:** Off track for 40 opportunities by end of Q1 (only ~30 work days left)
- Temporary adjustment: Combined target of 5/week for Rick + Will until end of March

### CMMC Event Planning
- **Format:** Online event (NOT a webinar) with 3-4 speakers, mix of pre-recorded and live
- **Date:** Late April 25th or 28th, possibly early May
- **Main speakers:** Annette (primary), Nikhil demo CMMC Ready Now software
- **Purpose:** Practice messaging, strengthen CGA relationship, evergreen content
- **Reality check:** May not generate leads; primary value is relationship building and content creation
- **Time requirement:** 5x longer to produce than expected

### Marketing AI Concerns Raised
- Nikhil flagged that Rick relies too heavily on AI-generated content
- Not reviewing/tweaking enough before publishing
- Need better human oversight of AI outputs

### New Product Ideas Discussed
1. **USB Security Device:** Ransomware protection as low-cost lead magnet ($15-60 range)
2. **Locksmith 24/7:** Side hustle partnership with John Zauskis (emergency call answering service)
3. **Go High Level:** Being added as a new rock for marketing automation

### Operational Needs
- **Naming Convention:** Nikhil to research and establish standardized file/document naming system
- **Training Calls:** Need to record sales calls for AI training purposes
- **Project Management:** CMMC event needs twice-weekly check-ins, Rick to PM with Nikhil approving

### Key Insight
Rick's strength is channel/partnership development, not direct sales. Focus should be on broker recruitment and CGA relationship, not hitting opportunity numbers directly.

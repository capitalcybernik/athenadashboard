# Session Memory: 2026-02-20

## Overnight Results
- Alaska published at 8:30 UTC — all 51 CMMC location pages now live (50 states + DC)
- SEO audit completed, report saved to `reports/seo-audit-2026-02-20.md`
- SEO report emailed to nikhil@capital-cyber.com
- Sub-agents for tasks 1, 2, 3 failed overnight due to gateway pairing error + API rate limits
- Root cause: spawned all 4 simultaneously instead of spacing them apart
- Gateway "pairing required" fix: added `operator.write` scope to paired device

## SEO Report Correction
- Removed CrowdStrike, Sophos, SentinelOne from competitor list (they're software vendors, not service providers)

## Dart AI
- Task created: "Review: 51 CMMC Location Pages" (ID: MJtvl2h2vB5I) — High priority, To-do
- Dartboard must use `Master Control/Ares Tasks` (duplicate name in old EOS-CC space)
- All tasks are Ares' tasks. Rick reviews them. Never create tasks "for" someone else.

## SLCGP Outreach Plan
- Scraped all 56 SAA contacts from FEMA SLCGP page
- Plan: CGA introduces itself as nonprofit resource for SLCGP grant recipients
- One professional email per state contact, not bulk marketing
- Email template needs Nikhil's approval before sending
- Scheduled for Friday draft, Saturday send

# CMMC Compliance for Manufacturing Companies

Your shop floor runs on legacy systems. Your contracts require CMMC Level 2. Most manufacturers fail their first assessment because they treated IT security like an afterthought.

We fix that.

## The Manufacturing CMMC Problem

Manufacturing has unique DNA that breaks standard compliance playbooks:

**Operational Technology (OT)** — Your CNC machines, PLCs, and SCADA systems weren't built with NIST 800-171 in mind. They're running Windows 7. They can't take antivirus. And they definitely can't be taken offline for patching.

**Legacy Infrastructure** — That 15-year-old ERP system holding your CUI? It doesn't support MFA. The vendor went out of business. And it costs $200K to replace.

**Supply Chain Chaos** — You're a Tier 3 supplier. Your customer is a Tier 2. The prime is Boeing. By the time flow-down requirements reach you, they're misunderstood, misapplied, or missing entirely.

**Flat Networks** — Shop floor, front office, guest WiFi, and vendor remote access all on the same VLAN. Segmenting them means downtime. Downtime means missed deliveries. Missed deliveries mean lost contracts.

**Distributed Locations** — Corporate in Virginia. Plant in Alabama. Warehouse in Texas. Each location needs the same security posture, same documentation, same assessment scope.

## How We Approach Manufacturing CMMC

### 1. Production-First Network Design

We segment your network without stopping production. CUI gets isolated in an enclave. OT stays operational. IT gets locked down. You pass assessment AND hit your delivery dates.

### 2. Legacy System Hardening

Can't patch it? We compensate with:
- Network micro-segmentation
- Application allowlisting
- Enhanced logging and monitoring
- Air-gapped data flows
- Compensating control documentation

### 3. OT Security Engineering

Our team includes industrial control system (ICS) specialists. We speak Modbus, EtherNet/IP, and OPC-UA. We know the difference between patching a server and bricking a $500K milling center.

### 4. Multi-Site Standardization

One security program. Multiple locations. We build it once, deploy everywhere, maintain consistency. Your Alabama plant gets the same protection as your Virginia HQ.

### 5. Supply Chain Clarity

We map your actual CUI flow:
- Where does it enter? (Customer portals, email, file shares)
- Where does it live? (ERP, file servers, workstations)
- Where does it exit? (Subcontractors, suppliers, shipping docs)

Then we build controls that protect it without killing productivity.

## What You Get

**Gap Assessment** — Know your real score before the C3PAO shows up. We assess against all 110 NIST 800-171 controls, document the gaps, and build a remediation roadmap prioritized by risk and cost.

**System Security Plan (SSP)** — Manufacturing-specific documentation that describes your actual environment. Not a template. Not copy-paste. Real documentation that assessors can follow and you can defend.

**Remediation Implementation** — We do the work. Network segmentation. MFA deployment. Logging infrastructure. Policy development. Training delivery. You focus on production; we handle compliance.

**C3PAO Readiness** — Pre-assessment validation. Evidence collection. Mock interviews. When the assessor arrives, you're ready. No surprises. No fails.

**Continuous Compliance** — CMMC isn't one-and-done. Annual assessments. Continuous monitoring. Ongoing documentation updates. We stay with you.

## Manufacturing-Specific Controls We Implement

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Legacy ERP without MFA | Jump box with PAM, certificate-based auth |
| Unpatchable OT systems | Network segmentation + passive monitoring |
| Flat production network | Micro-segmentation, zero-trust enclaves |
| Vendor remote access | Virtual air-gap, session recording, time-bound access |
| Paper-based CUI (drawings, travelers) | Controlled printing, scanning workflow, secure destruction |
| Multi-site standardization | Unified GRC platform, consistent tool stack |

## ROI: What CMMC Compliance Gets You

**Contract Retention** — Your existing DoD contracts are at risk without certification. One $2M contract covers your entire compliance investment.

**New Contract Eligibility** — CMMC is now a gatekeeper. No certification, no bid. We make you eligible.

**Insurance Savings** — Cyber liability premiums drop 15-30% with documented controls. Some insurers require CMMC-aligned security regardless.

**Operational Efficiency** — The same segmentation that passes CMMC also contains ransomware outbreaks. One prevented incident saves millions.

## Why Manufacturing Companies Choose Capital Cyber

**We've Been in Your Plants** — Our team has worked in manufacturing environments. We know the difference between theory and production reality.

**No Downtime Deployment** — We schedule changes during planned maintenance. No surprise shutdowns. No missed deliveries.

**Engineers, Not Just Analysts** — OT security requires engineering mindset. Our team includes CISSP, GICSP, and PE-certified professionals.

**Defense-Focused** — We only work with the Defense Industrial Base. CMMC isn't a side offering. It's our core expertise.

**Fixed-Price Options** — Know your costs upfront. No hourly surprises. No scope creep. Predictable budgeting for predictable outcomes.
